## Question: Acceleration
- For question 1, if t is time (sec), what are the units of $a$?
$$
\frac{m}{s}=\frac{m}{s}+at
$$
 **You can't add units that are different types, so the units of $at$ are $\frac{m}{s}$**
$$
\begin{align*}
at=\frac{m}{s}\\
a*(\sec)=\frac{m}{\sec}\\
a=\frac{m}{s^{2}}
\end{align*}
$$


$a$ stands for acceleration, what are the units of acceleration, can we work our way there? HYPOTHESIS TESTING

First we did a demo, and observed the below concept. Any model **must** show this to be correct
- [0]  If I take a long time, the acceleration is low, if I take a short time, **the acceleration is very high.**

What if the units of $a$ were $meters*time$ ?
Then acceleration would go up linearly with time, 

### Gravity
- The longer you fall, the faster you go.
- **THE MORE TIME WE ARE IN THE AIR, THE MORE WE CAN PICK UP SPEED**

> [!Question] If the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8$\frac{m}{s^{2}}$,and the conversion of meters to feet is 3.28, what is the acceleration of gravity in $\frac{ft}{min^{2}}$
> 

| 9.8 m   | 3.28 ft | $(60\sec)^{2}$ |
| ------- | ------- | -------------- |
| $s^{2}$ | m       | $(1min)^{2}$   |
The above would be our unit conversion. Note that to get minutes we need to square our usual ratio so that we can get the unit $\sec^{2}$ on the top.
