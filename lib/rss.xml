Dear ---,<br>
My name is Azal Amer, I am a Physics-CS double major studying at UT Austin. I recently came across quantumflytrap, and was a huge fan of your website. The interface is so intuitive, and I would have really appreciated a tool like this when i was first learning about quantum optics. A personal project of mine has been to make websites demonstrating different physical phenomena, and coming up with a good pedagogy to use when writing websites for quantum behaviors has been something I've struggled with. I was wondering if you could point me in the direction of any papers that helped motivate the creation of the site? Quantumflytrap has such a high level of polish, and I'd love to learn how to make similar tools.<br>
I've attached my resume which includes my quantum-optics experience if that helps.<br>
Hope you're doing well, and thank you so much for your time!<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Azal Amer (he/him)
<br><br>The goal is that Alice randomly selects a basis to prepare her signal in, and then inside that basis the orthogonal axis are labelled 0,1. Bob receives the signal ,randomly measures the bits. Then they publicly announce what gates they both used, and keep the resulting bits. If Eve was monitoring at any useful rate, Alice and Bob can just announce a portion of their key and see if it matches. If the bits don't match at a certain rate, then you assume an intruder, and repeat the procedure.<br>
This generates the OTP, which you can then use a classical channel to transmit information over!<br>
On average, you retain <br><br>qubits after you want to check your qubits.<br>
90% of the difficulty with a quantum computer, is implementing identity<br>

Given some function 

The function can be the identity function, the NOT function, the constant 1 function, or the constant zero function<br>

Essentially, you want to know if the function of constant or balanced. How many accesses to  do we need.
<br>Classically, the query complexity of the Deutsch-Jozsa task is .<br>
The quantum query complexity, is .  The reason why, is that we use superposition to query the both possible states.<br>Definition (Generalized Deutsch-Jozsa ).
<br>
Goal <br>
We can use the regular DJ to get the parity of  then  etc. Then you take all those results, then XOR those results (in a classical) to get your final answer with  queries. We're not going to count those extra  XOR's, because we didn't need to access  again.
<br>Can you do better than ?
Parity has an underlying recursive structure, I could keep applying DJ to the new processed bits until I end up finishing? The issue, is uncomputing! Your factor of 2 speedup, is balanced out by the need to uncompute the garbage at each layer. This just gives us  query complexity again.
