 A finite gate set  is approximately universal if for any , there exists  such that

For a smaller , you'd just apply more gates from the set arbitrarily.<br>

Classical computers are discrete in nature, so we can exhaust the gate set and implement it. That's not the case for quantum computer. The gate-set can't be exhausted, only approximated. Both use gates to implement algorithms, but only one in practice, can implement all the algorithms in its space.<br>
<br>This might be more of an equal disadvantage, because this means that some algorithm just exhaust large quantities of time, just like classical
