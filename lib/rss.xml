The magnitude of the E field is discontinuous at the edge of the sphere, but the potential is constant on the interior since the E field is zero inside!

<br>The best known classical algorithm comes from the number field sieve. The runtime of this algorithm is <br>Any developments in better factoring or cryptography, is often met by improvements to discrete logarithms.<br>Definition ( Elliptic Curve Cryptography (CVV)).
An elliptic curve is the set of solutions to an equation in the form


Whenever you have an elliptic curve, you have some special points on it in a group. There's a fancy type of multiplication which takes two points in a group, and takes you to the result also on the curve.<br>
Given , an attacker wants to find those 3 points<br>

<br>Definition (Lattice Based Cryptography).

The idea, is that the public key is a "Bad basis", which can still help you generating those selected points. 
<br>Just in the last year, there was a paper which came very close to breaking lattice-based-cryptography. After the first week it was retracted over a bug.<br>If you can generalize Shor's algorithm from Abelian groups to non-abelian groups, then you can break lattice based cryptography.<br>If you can generalize Shor's algorithm to the dihedral group, then you can break lattice-based crypto.  If you can generalize it it to all possible groups, then it can solve the graph isomorphism problem  all in polynomial time.<br>Definition (Graph Isomorphism problem).
Given two graphs, is there a way of rearranging the vertices and renaming, in such a way to prove the graphs are isomorphic
<br>I never worked on this. It just looked like Vietnam, more and more troops sent in to no avail. <br>A common misinterpretation of Shor's algorithm, is that it just tests every superposition. Then whichever one has the answer just like, calls out?<br>
This isn't how Shor works, but it is how Grover's does!<br><br>Definition (Search Problem).
Given a function <br>
Decision Version:

Is there an  s.t  

Search Version (Promised at least 1  s.t ) : 

Find 

 is called a marked item<br>
A simple description, is I guarantee that there is treasure in one of  boxes, finding which box there's treasure in.
<br>If I solved the Search Version, I can solve decision by just knowing. The algorithm will just never find an entry so we know the decision version.<br>If I can efficiently solve the decision version, how can I use that to solve the search. Well just use binary search! Split boxes in half, ask if there's an item in first or second half. Keep shrinking divisions.<br>Classical Algorithms<br>
