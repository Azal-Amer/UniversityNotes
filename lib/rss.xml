 <br><br>Last time they discussed differential operators, gradients, curl, divergence, etc.<br>
We're reviewing:<br>
<br>coordinate systems (Spherical and Cylindrical)
<br>Nabla operators in those coordinate systems
<br>Line integrals<br>
This is appreciated, because I didn't get much from Beckner<br>
Friday we're reviewing the classic vector calc theorems.
<br><br><br><br><br>This has a divergence of 1. because the direction of the vector never changes, it is defined with a fixed direction.<br>
In general we start with some vector  where<br><br>To get the unit vector, you divide the vector by its magnitude<br>Definition (Unit Vector).
For any given vector , the unit vector  is defined such that it lies along the same direction as , with magnitude 1. 

<br>To get the divergence of our vector<br><br>A non-zero divergence is equivalent to to having field aligned divergences and the direction of the flow changes outward. A divergence can be zero if the two terms compensate for each other. The strength changes, but the field spreads out and then comes back in. This is why divergence is a scalar product! It explains variations on a field form all directions.<br>Question
Can you really product rule in this way? The divergence operator feels different from the gradient operator
<br>What does it mean to take. the gradient of a scalar?
the magnitude. isa multivariable function  so we just take the gradient as we would normally.
<br>Example (Find the divergence of ).
The divergence has a first term of zero, and the field is anti-aligned across the component's axis which. is also zero.

<br>Example (Div = 0, but dield lines aren't straight : ).

Notice how even though the direction of the vector. is changing, we seem to flow in a specific direction

AT HOME, work this tragic thing through with the gradients
<br>Why did we do this at all? This seems more complicated than the standard way of calculating the divergence
It's just to build a visual intuition for the behavior, and how they do the same thing
<br>An aside, I just called tennerani torabi, I'm gonna explode actually. <br>Definition (Gradient Operator).
Given some function , who's orthonormal basis is spanned by the set of , we define the gradient as

<br>Definition (Divergence).
Given some vector   we define the divergence ( ) as

<br>Definition (Curl).
Given some vector   we define the curl ( ) as

<br><br>Example ( Given : Find ).
In other words, describe this VVF in spherical coordinates. 

We'd just use the Jacobian right?

To do this, recall the following conversion identities


I'm actually crashing out getting a name wrong is so embarrassing I swear I was just thinking about girl day

To solve it into spherical coordinates, you use these identities to solve for the angles. I don't want to type that out, but it happens through taking projections. Take the dot product of your cartesian components, with your spherical basis vectors.

Doesn't have anything to do with the levels, we'd want to go into thte rest frame. We took teh rest frame to sit on the proton, but that's not exact. It doesn't change anything about the calculation itself.
<br><br>The final stops exactly at the official hour when the official exam stops ~On Friday the 13th~<br>
There's one question which is straightforward, but really tedious. You won't get time to crunch the algebra out the last minute.<br>
<br>
9 matrix elements to compute. They're all of the same kind. The grader is going to be gentle over stupid mistakes<br>
Write nice and clear because the grader also has some rough exam. Beware of a haunting colleague of Fischer's.

<br>
There's a perturbation theory, and it asks us to calculate to a leading order. That means we have to calculate to the first non-zero leading term<br>
- Some problems might need to make you go further down<br>
- If the leading correction is a quadratic, you have to work to that order<br>
- There's over a week for this, so he's considering it a homework. Only one question on perturbation theory<br>
There's one question on angular momentum.

<br>
Orginal angular momentum there's only integers

<br>
Spin angular momentum is half<br>
Leave solving terrible integrals for the end, at at least get to those points.

<br>8 homeworks 25% on homework, 25% on tests, 30% for the final.<br>
<br>Not dropping nothing
<br>The grades are going to be histogram'ed, first group get's an A, etc etc. If you sit between a group you get pushed up.
<br>It sounds like there was leniency to the homework submission<br>
The grader is gonna upload the solutions to homework 7 and 8
<br>We can also send him an email
<br>What's the best way to study
Don't just cram the night before the exam and pray. Go over the homeworks we'e done, look at the questions. See if you can sketch a solution to it. Compare to the solution, then go again. (Do the same with the tests)

 <br>Why physically is there the energy difference in the denominator
When you do the math, that's just how it shakes out. The other thing, is to look at the units. The coefficients in the wave-function combinations has to be energy independent. The units have to cancel out energy.<br>
The other way to think of it, is that   is already known to be small called  (called squiggle in this class).  represents the fact that the wave-functions on a bound state are oscillatory. If two states. arefar apart in energy, one wiggles alot, and one doesnt wiggle at all. They won't combine well. Terms which are similar frequencies combine really well.
In theory. Because of the wiggles on the energies match perfectly, we get a division by zero error,. In that event, we need degenerate perturbation. theory.  are both at the same energies which means all 
their linear combinations are the same energy.

□<br>How do we go about reducing this further?<br>Exercise (Given a particle in the below potential, what is the first order correction to the energy going to look like? Would it increase the energy, keep it at zero, or reduce it? ).

Answer

Only second order corrections have an influence over the center. The odd functions get integrated over an odd potential symmetrically, which means that it's zero. We extend this from <a data-href="../../Quantum 1/Notes/2.1 Motion in Potential Function, and Pairity#^c9c667" href="https://azalamer.com/UniversityNotes/Quantum 1/Notes/2.1 Motion in Potential Function, and Pairity#^c9c667" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">../../Quantum 1/Notes/2.1 Motion in Potential Function, and Pairity &gt; ^c9c667</a><a data-href="../../Quantum 1/Notes/2.1 Motion in Potential Function, and Pairity#^c9c667" href="https://azalamer.com/UniversityNotes/school/physics/quantum-1/notes/2.1-motion-in-potential-function,-and-pairity.html#^c9c667" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Definition 2.1.3 (Pairity)</a> 

<br><br><br>Definition 2.1.3 (Pairity).
We're going to define a term parity. Where you define the operator 

 <br>
<br>This is just like if functions are odd or even
<br>Applying a particle in an electric field is just like this! You can then know right off the bat that the potential is then odd in parity. We can produce an electric field across the box so that it's anti-symmetric. <br>We're basically doing first order perturbation theory on the perturbed wave-function when we have potentials like this. The first order just normalizes the probability distribution.<br>Weird thing from <a data-href="../../Quantum 1/Notes/3.3 Introduction to Perturbation Theory#^energyOf2ndEps" href="https://azalamer.com/UniversityNotes/Quantum 1/Notes/3.3 Introduction to Perturbation Theory#^energyOf2ndEps" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">../../Quantum 1/Notes/3.3 Introduction to Perturbation Theory &gt; ^energyOf2ndEps</a><a data-href="../../Quantum 1/Notes/3.3 Introduction to Perturbation Theory#^energyOf2ndEps" href="https://azalamer.com/UniversityNotes/school/physics/quantum-1/notes/3.3-introduction-to-perturbation-theory.html#^energyOf2ndEps" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Theorem 3.3.5 (Second Perturbed Energy)</a> : The second order corrections to the ground state always lower it.

<br>Don't worry about time pressure, philo "do poorly cause you don't know"

<br>Stick around for another hour post class to work on it, just skip math


<br>You can have your notes, canvas, google, etc. 

<br>No communication btwn each other, no GenAI, etc


<br>Just like, be honest with your stuff
<br>You can run VQEL to support findings! Running circuits on IBM, etc.

<br>Checking matrix math too

An elliptic curve is the set of solutions to an equation in the form


Whenever you have an elliptic curve, you have some special points on it in a group. There's a fancy type of multiplication which takes two points in a group, and takes you to the result also on the curve.<br>

The idea, is that the public key is a "Bad basis", which can still help you generating those selected points.

A simple description, is I guarantee that there is treasure in one of  boxes, finding which box there's treasure in.
<br>If I solved the Search Version, I can solve decision by just knowing. The algorithm will just never find an entry so we know the decision version.<br>If I can efficiently solve the decision version, how can I use that to solve the search. Well just use binary search! Split boxes in half, ask if there's an item in first or second half. Keep shrinking divisions.<br>Classical Algorithms<br>
