<br>Don't worry about time pressure, philo "do poorly cause you don't know"

<br>Stick around for another hour post class to work on it, just skip math


<br>You can have your notes, canvas, google, etc. 

<br>No communication btwn each other, no GenAI, etc


<br>Just like, be honest with your stuff
<br>You can run VQEL to support findings! Running circuits on IBM, etc.

<br>Checking matrix math too

An elliptic curve is the set of solutions to an equation in the form


Whenever you have an elliptic curve, you have some special points on it in a group. There's a fancy type of multiplication which takes two points in a group, and takes you to the result also on the curve.<br>

The idea, is that the public key is a "Bad basis", which can still help you generating those selected points.

<br>I never worked on this. It just looked like Vietnam, more and more troops sent in to no avail. <br>A common misinterpretation of Shor's algorithm, is that it just tests every superposition. Then whichever one has the answer just like, calls out?<br>

A simple description, is I guarantee that there is treasure in one of  boxes, finding which box there's treasure in.
<br>If I solved the Search Version, I can solve decision by just knowing. The algorithm will just never find an entry so we know the decision version.<br>If I can efficiently solve the decision version, how can I use that to solve the search. Well just use binary search! Split boxes in half, ask if there's an item in first or second half. Keep shrinking divisions.<br>Classical Algorithms<br>
