 <br><br><br><br>Why is the magnetic moment in an electron much larger to the proton?
Magnetic moment is inversely proportional to mass
<br><br>The hamiltonian couples the directions of  and . This means the magnitudes are still good, l but the quantum numbers  and  are not. <br>What is a "good quantum number"? Why aren't , good?
This is because now the operators don't freely commute. Knowing one quantum number means you can't know the other. 
<br>The projection of those numbers onto  are good, but we don't really get anything useful form them. That means that our only good remaining quantum numbers are  and . (Direction and magnitude quantum numbers).<br>
An Aside<br>
Last time, we learned about a new operator  where

<br>A good quantum number is one which isn't coupled together. What makes  good is that despite the coupling, it's a vector sum and is itself unique despite it's linear combination being non-unique. <br>

<br>Can you use this to make a better transistor?
"If you don't know about spin-orbit interactions, you have no hope of understanding the semi-conductor. I can't say you'll use this to make a better transistor, but you use this to make a transistor that works"
<br><br>How do you know which of those new energy states are wide enough you can measure?<br>
<br>That's called a selection rule! The selection rule says for us to be able to see a new energy level, 
<br>Why?
You need to conserve momentum. Can't go from a  momentum to  momentum
<br>You can't go from  to another . What you can do is go from any energy  to . When you calculate that from , you find that there are 5 possible  transitions! Below is what they are:<br>

<br>We can be outside the box
<br>Infinitely many states inside an infinite well, finite number of bound states<br>
Can you ever make the well so shallow that there are no states in it?
<br>Nope, there's always at least one!
<br>The energy doesn't go by the quantum number squared anymore <br>
There is a lot of the wave-function outside the well, where it's potential energy exceeds the potential energy.<br>
Outside the well, the wavefunction is always an exponential decay. Plus outside the box at the edge, we get an inflection point!
<br><br>Imagine that we brought in another well, and slowly moved it next to our current well. Can we use perturbation theory to calculate the new energy?<br>Why does it have to be slow? He made it a point to point out that it basically crawled it's way here
This will be answered later when we talk about time elements
<br><br><br>Theorem 3.3.3 (First Perturbed Energy).
The first order correction to the energy on the th energy level is just the expectation value of the perturbation in the unperturbed state 

 <br>The complication comes in because of the stipulation that the wells are identical. <br>
<br>There would be a bound state within the new well, which has it's own bound state. It would have it's own energy
<br>This might need to be a degenerate perturbation theory

It's a bit questionable, but let's see where it goes.<br>
The diagonals make sense to be equal, since in the reference frame of our perturbation well, the original is perturbing it.<br>

<br>Don't do with peers
<br>Questions are essentially "do the integral", so do the integral yourself.
<br>Midterm is open note
<br>Midterm is on the style of the second homework other than the first one. Up until chapter 2.4.1<br>
Your work has to be intelligible<br>
There are 4 main questions, with subsections. Nothing unfamiliar with other upperdivs<br><br>Conductors only have surface charges, no bulk charges. Additionally because they have mobile charges, you can induce charge distributions onto a conductor.<br>
The electric field to the right of an infinite charged plate is<br><br>The electric field is discontinuous if the plane was completely thin, but you can't be discontinuous.

Otherwise it is continuous.<br>But in real life it can't be. How do we resolve the discontinuity
Probably because of the skin depth. There is no delta function of charge distribution, it is distributed along the surface with narrow depth.
<br>For a conducting sphere, this then means that  is<br><br>Before we did the perpendicular field, now we want the parallel.<br><br>Now similar to before, we're going to take a line integral over our new loop .

The electric field inside the conductor must be zero, therefore the only non-zero component is the perpendicular one just off of the surface.<br>

Because the proton has such a high , it tells us it can't be a point particle
<br>Why does the high  on the proton tell us it can't be a point particle
SR tells us that a point particle with spin  must have a  factor of . We can measure the proton having  spin and it's  factor, the only contradiction is the assumption is that it must be a point particle

There are points where the electron's magnetic moment lines up with the proton's field, and points with complete disagreement.

 <br><br><br><br>Why is the 21 cm line so important? <br>
<br>The big bang happened, rapidly expanded really really hot and was super charged. Things then cooled off and things could recombine to become neutral hydrogen.
<br>All of a sudden the radiation ejected when the hydrogen formed and cooled and we got the CMB
<br>After that, stars took over. They re-ionized the hydrogen with their UV from the stars. Re-ionization is when neutral hydrogen stepped out and came back. The 21cm wavelength with the redshift lets you study this period of the universe!

It was literally everything, so it should have. But the answer is that there was no place to collapse to
<br>Why is it that  are plus anad minus?
It has to do with the phase. "Down" can mean different thing in different ways. We can still end up with a zero projection onto the  axis, if our resultant vector is perpendicular. This is regardless of length

<br>We're now going to move to Clebcsh-Gordon values. <br><br>To use a Clebcsh-Gordon table, the red vertical column represents your  state. Your green row represents the corresponding identical  quantum numbers.<br>Exercise (AT HOME: To better understand, go through this and see how you can pull  <a data-href="#^7fcef6" href="https://azalamer.com/UniversityNotes/about:blank#^7fcef6" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">^7fcef6</a><a data-href="#^7fcef6" href="https://azalamer.com/UniversityNotes/about:blank#^7fcef6" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">(1.12.2)</a> from this result).<br>To get the coefficients in the table, you can then use the raising and lowering operators. Remember that the raising and lowering operators only act on the projection quantum number, it's rotating.<br>Why is this table even useful?
If you had spin  particles, then your good basis might be more complicated and require more work. This table concisely represents all the transformations for you.

You can write  as that superposition, apply it to the state, then take the inner product
