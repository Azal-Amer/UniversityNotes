 <br>But# Overview<br><br>"Scott's travelling this week, sort of saving the world from AI, so I'm taking over"
- Nick Hunter Jones
<br>Feynman was the first guy to bring this up:<br>Say you wanted to simulate a quantum system, we know that <br><br>If I want to simulate this classically, I have to keep track of a lot of numbers. There's  's for n-qubit state. Pretty soon this scales up to the size of the observable universe.<br>
If I wanted to simulate 260 qubits, then it's , which is the number of atoms in the universe.<br>"If you want to simulate a quantum system, you should probably just use a quantum system."<br>The question, is can we then use a quantum system, to simulate a classical problem<br><br>Even if I can construct a quantum state where<br><br>This just collapses to a single output, since we have to make a measurement.<br>
Our only hope is to "choreograph an interference pattern".  <br><br>
<br>Just a a note,  is just some arbitrarily small coefficient. Can be polynomial or wtv.<br>
You want a way to make your incorrect answers have a very low probability, while your good solutions have a high one.
<br><br>But how do we build these unitaries? The key thing, is that these unitaries encode the program.<br>
We want to use k-level gates , things like 1 qubit gates or 2 qubit gates. This is just more practical cause it's easier to act on a few qubits at once, plus it's just modular.<br>
<br> is the space complexity, which is the number of qubits, similar to the number of bits
<br> is the number of gates in the circuit, or the depth
<br>How do we know it's possible to build n-qubit unitaries out of lower qubit gates?
What a great segway azal ðŸ’€, that's next!
<br><br><br>The fundamental question is, are there a set of gates which can be used to compose any ?<br>
<br>The analogous classical picture is building up any boolean function from  
<br>THIS makes sense from <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="../../Miscillaneous/Tidbit Facts/Cook-Levin Theorem" data-href="../../Miscillaneous/Tidbit Facts/Cook-Levin Theorem" href="https://azalamer.com/UniversityNotes/Miscillaneous/Tidbit Facts/Cook-Levin Theorem" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Cook-Levin Theorem</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="../../Miscillaneous/Tidbit Facts/Cook-Levin Theorem" data-href="../../Miscillaneous/Tidbit Facts/Cook-Levin Theorem" href="https://azalamer.com/UniversityNotes/school/miscillaneous/tidbit-facts/cook-levin-theorem.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cook-Levin Theorem</a>, cause any algorithm maps to a boolean one, which then is represented with a series of gates. So then a SAT solver would eject solutions to an arbitrary algorithm.
<br>What then is our fundamental set for quantum?<br><br> is our gate set.  is the cardinality of the set.<br>For some gate set  to be universal, our arbitrary n-qubit unitary must be able to be implemented through any qubits  <br>Definition (Exact Universality).
A gate set  has exact universality, when any  unitary  on a qubit of size , can be produced by tensoring gates in the set together. 

<br>Theorem (The Standard Gate Set is Universal).
The gate set defined as . Note that  must be continuous, so since the cardinalities of the set must match, the set  must also be continuous. 
<br>
<br>Can find this in Nielsen and Chuang Quantum Computation and Quantum Information
<br>The issue with Exact Universality, is that it can be really difficult to construct every possible transformation on a qubit, while in a lab.<br>Can we find a universal gate set, which is approximately universal? <br><br>Definition ((Approximate) Universal Gate Set).
 A finite gate set  is approximately universal if for any , there exists  such that

For a smaller , you'd just apply more gates from the set arbitrarily.<br>

Classical computers are discrete in nature, so we can exhaust the gate set and implement it. That's not the case for quantum computer. The gate-set can't be exhausted, only approximated. Both use gates to implement algorithms, but only one in practice, can implement all the algorithms in its space.<br>
