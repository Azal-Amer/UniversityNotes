We're going to define a term parity. Where you define the operator

<br><br><br>We are also conjecturing that the parity operator is Hermitian, because applying what is essentially a flip of your position, won't just throw out probabilities<br><br>Then <br><br>It seems intuitive that  would return , the parity operator has the behavior of flipping an eigenkets, so it would feel like it should flip operators too.<br>Exercise (AT HOME: Prove ).<br>Assuming we did prove that, we can go back to our hamiltonian definition <a data-href="1.10 Harmonic Oscillation#^HamiltonianDefinition" href="https://azalamer.com/UniversityNotes/1.10 Harmonic Oscillation#^HamiltonianDefinition" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="display: none;">1.10 Harmonic Oscillation &gt; ^HamiltonianDefinition</a><a data-href="1.10 Harmonic Oscillation#^HamiltonianDefinition" href="https://azalamer.com/UniversityNotes/school/quantum-1/notes/1.10-harmonic-oscillation.html#^HamiltonianDefinition" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">1.10 Harmonic Oscillation &gt; (1.10.1)</a>, and now we have a way of connecting the hamiltonian operator, to the parity operator<br><br>Exercise (AT HOME: Finish this proof).<br>□<br><br>The wave-function must be continuous, so we must match the values of the potential function at zero.
