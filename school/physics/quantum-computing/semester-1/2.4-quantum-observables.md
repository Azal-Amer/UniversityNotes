Find the unitary parameters for each member of the Pauli group

| Matrix | $\theta$        | $\phi$ | $\lambda$ |
| ------ | --------------- | ------ | --------- |
| I<br>  | 0               | 0      | 0         |
| X      | $\frac{\pi}{2}$ | 0      | 0         |
| Y      | $\pi$           | $\pi$  | $\pi$     |
| Z      |                 |        |           |
For every operation on a Bra, there's a corresponding operation on the ket

$$
\ket{\psi}=\alpha \ket{0} +\beta \ket{1}  
$$

The probability of a measurement of the "0" outcome is $P(0)=|\alpha|^2$
The probability of a measurement of the "1" outcome is $P(1)=|\beta|^2$
- $$
P(a)=|a|^2=aa^*=(x+iy)(x-iy)=x^2+y^2
$$

If you have some wave-function, and you want to see what the probability of measuring it in horizontal and vertical basis', you write it in terms of the basis you want to measure in, and square the amplitudes of each components to get the probabilities.

## Activity 1
### A) **Given a qbit state of the form**
$$
\ket{\psi} =\frac{1}{2}\ket{0} -\sqrt{ \frac{3}{4} }\ket{1}
$$
What is the probability of the measurement zero?
$$
\alpha=\frac{1}{2}
P(0)=|\alpha|^2=\frac{1}{4}
$$
### B) Given a qubit state of the form
$$
\ket{\phi} =\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 3}}
\begin{bmatrix}
\sqrt{ 2 } \\
e^{ i\pi/3} 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
what is the probability of measurement outcome "1"
 **Steps**
Rewrite in the form of  linear combination
$$
\ket{\phi}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\sqrt{ 2 }\ket{0}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 3 }}e^{ i\pi/3 }\ket{1}  
$$
We then want to square the complex exponential term
$$
P(1)=|\beta|^2=|\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 3 }}e^{ i\pi/3 }|^2
$$
Given $|z|=zz^*$, apply this to our exponential:
$$
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 3 }}e^{ i\pi/3 }*e^{ -i\pi/3 } \right)^2=\frac{1}{3}
$$
What you could have also recognized, is that any complex exponential form $e^{i\theta}$ is just a complex vector with length 1. **That just means that it's complex magnitude is also 1!**

# Born Again
We can measure $\psi$ in different bases, for measurements in the $\{\ket{H},\ket{B}\}$ basis, use linear sum from before.
**For $\{\ket{D},\ket{A}\}$  basis**
$$
\ket{\psi} = \frac{{\alpha+\beta}}{\sqrt{ 2 }}\ket{D}  +\frac{{\alpha-\beta}}{\sqrt{ 2 }}\ket{A}
$$

Complete Basis measurement. 
Prepare $\ket{\psi}$ and measure $\{\ket{\phi_{1}},\ket{\phi_{2}},\dots,\ket{\phi_{n}}\}$ 
Single State measurements would be done using an **inner product** ([[../Definitions/Bra-Ket Notation]]) between the basis and the quantum state
	*For Example, if $\phi_1=H$, then the measurement of $\ket{\psi}$ on the H basis is $\bra{H}\ket{\psi}$
		
## Complete Basis measurement
$$
\sum_{1}^N |\bra{\phi_{n}} \ket{\psi}|^2=1
$$
Where N is the number of bases in the quantum system. This is simply the generalization from earlier.
$$
\text{Prob}[\ket{\phi_{1}} ]=|\bra{\phi_{1}} \ket{\psi} |^2,\dots,\text{Prob}[\ket{\phi_{n}} ]=|\bra{\phi_{n}} \ket{\psi}  |^2
$$

The more we measure out of the quantum system, the more we destroy it.
**Demolition Measurement**- Game over, photon Absorbed *i.e* Complete basis measurement
- *Example: BB84 Eve*, if Eve measures a quantum state, Alice's original $\ket{\psi}$ is destroyed, and Eve just has to guess what Alice originally had to pass it along
**Non Demolition Measurement**- State collapses to the measured state.

### Passive Vs Active Measurements
We can physically rotate the polarizing beam splitter to go from H/V basis to D/A. But that's really annoying, hard to do mechanically or reliably.

Instead, we can use a Hadamard gate! It's a unitary, so the vector length isn't changing.

[[../Definitions/Orthonormal Bases]] 

**Basis: It's just a set of ways to measure to uniquely determine the state.**
- Changing measurement basis is literally just redefining your axis, moving the axis but leaving the points on it just change how you describe the points. They haven't moved.
Math of the above!

$$

H\ket{D} \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }} \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{bmatrix} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
\ket{D}  & \ket{A} 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Then when we apply our logic of applying gates, the Hadamard just gives us a change of basis!
$$
\begin{align}
H^{{\dagger}}\ket{\psi}= 
\begin{pmatrix}
\ket{D}  & \ket{A} 
\end{pmatrix}^{\dagger}\ket{\psi} =\begin{pmatrix}
\bra{D}  \\
\bra{A} 
\end{pmatrix}\ket{\psi} =\begin{pmatrix}
\bra{D} \ket{\psi} \\
\bra{A} \ket{\psi}  
\end{pmatrix}=\bra{D} \ket{\psi}\ket{H}+ \bra{A} \ket{\psi}\ket{V} 
\end{align}
$$
## Activity 2
Given $\ket{R}$, what matrix can we use to map it to $\ket{0},\ket{1}$ ?
We'd want a gate such that
$$
Q ^{\dagger} = \begin{pmatrix}
\ket{R}^* \\
\ket{L}^*  
\end{pmatrix}

$$

^06f276
$$
Q ^{\dagger}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}\begin{pmatrix}
1 & -i \\
1 & i
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Doing this let's us make the amplitudes of horizontal the amplitude of one target basis, and the amplitude of vertical the amplitude of another target basis.

## General Orthonormal Basis Measurements
Given an orthonormal Basis $\{\ket{\phi)1},\ket{\phi)2}\}$
We can form a unitary matrix U=$\bigg( \ket{\phi_{1}},\ket{\phi_{2}}\bigg)$ 
Then performing a measurement is just $U ^{\dagger}\ket{\psi}$

Given that $\vec{\psi_{1}}$ and $\vec{\psi_{2}}$ are [[../../Linear Algebra/5.1 Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues#^ab6240|eigenvectors]]  of A (or [[../Definitions/Orthonormal Bases|Orthonormal Bases]]), then we can write A as a **projection sum**
$$
A = a_{1}\ket{\phi_{1}}\bra{\phi_{1}}+  a_{2}\ket{\phi_{2}}\bra{\phi_{2}}
$$
