|Diagram of two systems|

The temperature is 
$$
T = \frac{\partial S}{\partial E}^{-1}
$$
The probability of system 1 and system 2 being at $E_{1,2}$ is 

Entropy is 
$$
S = k_{B}\ln\Omega
$$
$$
P(E_{1},E_{2}) = \frac{{\Omega(E_{1})\Omega(E-E_{1})}}{\omega(E)}
$$
Let's say I have a room full of gas molecules, and I want to study the behavior of just one molecule, without knowing the micro-states of the whole room. Can use the temperature of the room to get information about one particle?
The large system (the room) is called the *reservoir* . 
## Deriving the framework to get here

We know that $\Omega_{2}(E_{2})$ from the derivative
$$
\frac{{\partial S_{2}}}{\partial E_{2}}=\frac{{\partial k_{b}\ln\Omega_{2}}}{\partial E_{2}}
$$
The probability of a system 1 to be at energy $E_{1}$ is proportional to the number of micro-states in system 2.
For a given energy $E_{1}$, if multiple states give the same energy, they are all equally probable.

We want to find a way to use as little information as possible regarding system 2.

We're going to do 
$$
\begin{align}
\Omega_{2}(E_{2})=\exp(\ln\Omega_{2})\approx \exp \left[ \ln\omega_{2}\left( \bar{E_{2}} +\frac{{\partial \ln\Omega_{2}}}{\partial E}\bigg|_{E=\bar{E_{2}}}\right) \left( E_{2}-\bar{E_{2}} \right)  \right]   \\
\exp\left( \ln\Omega_{2}(\bar{E_{2}})+\frac{{E_{2}-\bar{E_{2}}}}{k_{B}T} \right)\\
\end{align}
$$
Give
$$
 \frac{1}{T} = \frac{\partial S}{\partial E}
$$
from earlier, we substitute that in
$$
\Omega_{2}(E_{2}) \approx\Omega_{2}(\bar{E_{2}})\exp \left[ \frac{{E_{2}-\bar{E_{2}}}}{k_{B}T} \right] 
$$
Then define $E_{1} = E-E_{2}$
$$
\begin{align}
p \propto \omega_{2}\left( E-E_{1} \right) =\Omega_{2}\left( E-\left( E_{1} \right) -\bar{E_{1}}+\bar{E_{1}} \right)  \\
=\Omega \left( \bar{E_{2}}-\left( E_{1}  -\bar{E_{1}} \right)\right)  \\
\approx\Omega_{2}\left( \bar{E_{2}} \right) \exp \left( \frac{\bar{E_{1}}}{k_{B}T} \right) \exp \left( -\frac{E_{1}}{k_{B}T} \right) 
\end{align}
$$

We want to understand as much information about system 1 as possible, with as little information about system 2.
This means that
