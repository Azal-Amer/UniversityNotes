from Daniel)\nHe's aiming for 10 programming assignments. They are done individually, until we hit the final project where we form groups and do stuff together\nWe're basically building an OS kernel. If you don't do well in one assignment, you'll build on it.\nWe will have different milestones. At some point he'll give us almost working code. To clarify, the twist is to make sure we just debug? That way no one is left behind, but he says it's at most a week.\nThere are no slip days.\nNo exams, but you have quizzes every two weeks. They tend to take half of the discussion sections\nYou can suggest quiz questions (oh so we're tricking people)\nIf someone needs the optional final, it's available to them which everyone works on togetherHe wants us to type out any code we get suggested.\nWe're responsible for everything we submit, including explaining to any detail. He can just randomly ask us for an interview which is within 24 hours. That's not like, if you just did your work it's if he suspects. So I should be okay cause I don't plagiarize my shit. Like my main concern was like, what if i was busy cause my schedule is dense\nFirst assignment due next week\nRead the textbook\nNever ask him what chapter we're on right nowThis class will be incredibly programming heavy, and it'll be in a specific style. Do we have a style guide you want us to adhere to?\nAll I care about is that your code is sane\nWe're programming in C++, so it's C with another things. \"It's really C with java thingies thrown in\"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#operatingSystems","#Computerscience"],"headers":[{"heading":"Overview","level":1,"id":"Overview_0"},{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"}],"links":["school/cs/cs-439/class-official-files/syllabus_s26_439.html","school/cs/cs-439/class-official-files/syllabus_s26_439.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"school/cs/cs-439/notes/0.1-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1768341343923,"modifiedTime":1768514485500,"sourceSize":1778,"sourcePath":"School/CS/CS 439/Notes/0.1 Introduction.md","exportPath":"school/cs/cs-439/notes/0.1-introduction.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":4,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"school/cs/cs-439/notes/1.1-what-is-an-operating-system.html":{"title":"1.1 What is an Operating System","icon":"","description":"We answered the title question, and roadmapped our time in the course!Caching is such a big deal, adn we're going to continuously reinvent caches perpetually. The L1 and L2's existence doesn't matter much to us because the hardware takes care of it.\nWe're recalling how a system worksWe're not calling the CPU a CPU.

The multiplexers and decoders become shallower as well so we only have to wait a cycle or two for register access.

There is fixed data burned into the system.The PCI-E bus is slower than DRAM. As we move further away from the CPU, the slower things get. You can basically rotate the above diagram 90틬 and guess about the speeds.Your USB lanes are sharing the lanes with your mouse and keyboard and all other things. A portable hard drive has write speeds then constrained by that bus's usage. That's why direct drives are more expensive, they manage dedicated lanes. Why did we never have to think of these things? The operating system managed it!\nAsking someone to program to this model would let us have three programers basically. We've abstracted everything away to be handled by the OS\nWe need something that makes this complicated thing simpler, and safer.\nSimpler: Managing sectors is beyond the programmer, they just want to open a file\nError handling: Someone was shaking the ground next to the disk, and the head might miss a line on a hard drive.\nOperating systems are what manage these complexities which keep them convenient and safe\nDefinition 1.1.2 (Operating System).\nOperating systems do the following: Abstraction: Makes the complex management of hardware, simple. Makes different things seem like the same. Plugging a disk via USB or NVME should look the same to the user. Keyboards should all act the same\nMake things up! A disk doesn't have a hierarchal namespace, only a linear array of addresses. The operating system is what manages the file structures. Resource Management Allocating loads to cores proportionally, multiplexing resources, etc. Give the perception to the user that when a program is run in memory, it's a process Protection There's nothing a process can do which effects another one, the illusion of isolation of state needs to be maintained Communicate Sometimes we want to be able to share data to a concurrent process or stream to multiple processes. This is an OS from the point of view to the programs.\nThe other perspective, which is provided to humans, is the UX. It's the GUI\nWe are completely ignoring the user experience of an operating system. That's only the last 3 weeks except for the last 3 weeks.\nThe nature of an operating system is strictly software. The OS is the thing which makes it convenient for programs to run, but the OS itself is a program. The OS has to deal with every complexity to manage the other programs. It takes the burden of the hard problems, so no one else has to. We're going to specifically prevent ourselves from using exceptions in C++! Exceptions need OS's to workWhen you try and run it, the program gets it's own space in memory, allocates it's resources, and then starts running it.\nA program becomes a process by loading it in memory, initializing that memory, and pointing the PC at that point to run. The OS does that!\nThe operating system needs to get memory, and then tell it to run it to the right point. This is the bootstrapping problem. There has to be something magical acting at the early operating system point which loads the operating system to memory.\nThis is the firmware! (It's not hard, it's not soft, it's firm)\nIt has to be the thing that no one has to write it in memory, which is on a ROM! The ROM is the firmware's home. Whoever manufactured the system, and went into memory to put the firmware down.\nTypically we will use flash memory for this, with NOR flash so it's byte addressable.\nThe oldest kind of firmware is the BIOS. The BIOS does some self checks, and once it's happy with the hardware it loads the OS.Then it scans the disks, and scans the disks to see if there's anything that looks to be an operating system.\nHow does it know what an operating system looks like? It doesn't! It just needs something in the memory to say \"I have an operating system in me\". It can lieWe think about a disk as an array of swectorsAbove is an example of what it looks like for us to tell the BIOS that there is a BIOS present in memoryIf any sector 0 contains an MBR, we say that it is what knows how to run an OS.\nWhat if multiple claim to have an OS?\nUsed to be undefined, but now we give people a menu\nIf the last two bytes in the first sector are FF, AA, then we interpret it as an MBR. What if your disk has that byte-string by accident? Sucks, don't do that.\nThen the remaining 510 bytes is the operating system512 BFFAARAM0x7C00\nNow we jump to this address at 0x7C00 and the operating system has been loaded into the BIOS. You better fit your operating system in 510 bytes. We're bootstrapping the system slowly, that stuff will load slowly, that stuff will load more stuff, etc etc until we have a full system. Putting your OS on a disk means that you better put 510 bytes that know how to load in the rest of your system.\nAt this point, we need to look inside the filesystems of the disks to find the operating systems. The stage 1 thing loads the boot-loader over the operating system directly.\nThe boot-loader does the harder stuff, scanning the disk and finding all the operating systems which are possible to use in the disk. This software is more complicated.The bootloader we will use is called LimineThe first thing loaded from the bootloader is our KERNEL. That is the heart of any operating system\nBy the time we get to the Kernel, it's running by itself and the other two processes are killedIn order, the system starts and runs the memory in ROM. That is the BIOS. That then searches disks for the MBB based on the FF AA criteria. The 510 bytes above the 0xFFAA are responsible for loading your bootloader. Then the bootloader searches for operating systems.\nHWBIOSS.WStage 1BootloaderKernelLimine0xffff800000Kernel SpaceUser SpaceMusicEmailssh....BrowserLPDCritical System ProcessesOS\nThere has to be someone who finds the system (because it's written to do this), it goes \"Im the first program to be started like this here, the other processes are dead, I am responsible for this land\"\nThe kernel sits there going \"What is my job in life\"\nwe can try to multiplex between programs so that they aren't al in the CPU A subset is running in actual parallel at a given time defined by the number of cores we have. So how did single core systems have an OS? Don't we need to keep it always running if it manages the programs?\nAt some point the kernel might realize it's not needed software, as it's an interface without someone using it. The kernel then loads the first program into memoryBut then at one point we might want a GUI, so those are actually implemented as user processes.\nOur class will spend the bulk of our time in the kernel. It is the most important part of the operating system, but it is not the whole thing. We will spend so much time on the kernel the others might be forgotten.For next time walk through the linker","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#operatingSystems","#computerArch","#Computerscience","#kernel"],"headers":[{"heading":"Overview","level":1,"id":"Overview_0"},{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"Motivation","level":2,"id":"Motivation_0"},{"heading":"Operating Systems","level":2,"id":"Operating_Systems_0"},{"heading":"How does a Program Become a Process?","level":2,"id":"How_does_a_Program_Become_a_Process?_0"},{"heading":"Early 1980s technology","level":3,"id":"Early_1980s_technology_0"}],"links":["school/cs/cs-429/notes/11.4-seq-to-pipe-.html","school/cs/cs-429/notes/11.4-seq-to-pipe-.html","school/cs/cs-429/notes/7.1-operands-and-data-processing.html","school/cs/cs-429/notes/7.1-operands-and-data-processing.html","school/cs/cs-429/notes/13.4-cache-structure-and-management.html","school/cs/cs-429/notes/13.4-cache-structure-and-management.html","school/cs/cs-429/notes/13.3-structure-of-caches.html","school/cs/cs-429/notes/13.3-structure-of-caches.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"school/cs/cs-439/notes/1.1-what-is-an-operating-system.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1768343130201,"modifiedTime":1768595756437,"sourceSize":10943,"sourcePath":"School/CS/CS 439/Notes/1.1 What is an Operating System.md","exportPath":"school/cs/cs-439/notes/1.1-what-is-an-operating-system.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":5,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"school/cs/cs-439/notes/1.2-c++-intro-and-code-from-an-os.html":{"title":"1.2 C++ Intro and Code from an OS","icon":"","description":"Today we're walking through how code works for operating systems in our classWe don't need to memorize what he's gonna show us, it'll be posted in ed. All the code we look at will also be shared with us directly.\nI wish he'd have given it to us earlier so I could annotate it tho\ngheith/work/cs439_s26_pi{eid} is the naming scheme the Github usually usesWe all have our own dedicated repositories which he hosts, and it automatically runs the tests. We can push as many times as we want, and it'll auto-compile and report back the results to us\nThis is cool!\nI think it's cool he hosts his own git repos too\nWhen we submit, our tests run on everybody's tests. The tests are not secret, and we can look at them on a separate repo (unless there's like a really possible specific case where you could bypass a test)We need to compile with the C++ compiler, but it's evolving. Lots of compilers exist, some have bugs some have extensions, and we are running in a bizzare environment where there's no standard environment and we're restricted on features. We want to be running the same copy of the compilerThe compiler on the cs machines is ancient (8 years old) and lacks features that we'd want to use. This means we'd need to use the copy of the compiler that he uses\nTo do that, we need to add his compiler to the PATH! Which is a great chance for us to learn about the PATH.\nThe shell will reference the PATH for commands that it doesn't recognize.\nIs the command he's giving us only going to persist for the current session? Yeah, but you can just add this to the .profile or .bashrc\n$PATH is for executables\nIt is wise to only add things to the PATH when I'm running my assignments. If I put it in my ,profile, I'd forget to remove things for it. I'd be stuck still picking this c++ compiler, so it could be picky\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH is for shared libraries\nWe are using C++23\nPATH = ~geith/public/tools26/bin:**$PATH**\nWe're building an operating system kernel, you want to be running directly on the hardware so we need a machine without an operating system. He doesn't want to give us one, and even if we bought a raspberry pi to do it we won't be able to debug.\nWe're running our code in an emulator. The emulator is so good we might forget that it's close enough to the hardware. But it's not perfect, and there are moments when the emulator differs from real hardware. Either in function or performance. He will point out to us where the emulator fails\nIf we find ourself stuck in a loop waiting for something to change (bad idea because you have wasted cycles) then there's a function called imstuckinaloopThe emulator is just qemu-system-x86_64. With arm it's also easy but it's aarch64How does this emulator even...work?How does QEMU not just step on the operating system's toes while it works?The outcome inside qemu should be identical to hardware To bootstrap, we need to compile a kernel first. And we don't have a filesystem yet. The main entry point to the kernel is going to be the test cases we're running. The kernel will come up, run the test case, and go down. Later we will run a loader which will prevent it from going down. The kernel directory is what we really care about\nThe build directory is where all the outputs go\nThe limine folder is the boot loader we're going to be using. We don't need to even look at this code. He will tell us exactly what we need to know about it as we go\nThe tools subfolder we don't care about at all\nThe root of the project has a bunch of interesting files. The important ones for us are the test files. The root will have tests.\nOur test are going to be a function kind of like main, but called kernel_main. That's the entrypoint into the program. This is not the first thing that gets called. For our concern, this is the beginning. Any logic we want goes in there.\nHe will give us code, and give us some tests. Ignore the tests he gives us at first. Copy them into another file named after your eid (any .cc file gets interpreted as a test), then start form fresh. The test cases in here would be the best for implementing features\nHe does have a makefile running in there, we don't have to look in it but it will help to just see how the system is being done. In our current implementation we have to build a unique kernel for each test we use.\nThe two important files for us are the .kernel\n(kernel executable)\nEditing and viewing ti aren't very useful, but there are tools we can learn to take a peek into them\nYou can use the dflag with objdump and convert it to a disassembler (The far left will say the value of the PC at which that command runs) the object dump will let us see what part of the file we failed on via the PC!The image file built is the most important. It's a disk image for us to run QEMU on. This is cool, the makefile builds our image. Wait so how did we do this?\nOh wait he shows us! I won't type it out all here, he said \"I cannot type this code myself\". He put a comment with a citation\nsgdisk is a command line tool which does disk partitioning! That's actually very useful cause going to every computer and having to find something with an interface is a huge pain. \"You don't need to memorize any of this, it'll be common code.\"Once we have the image file, we're ready to hang the file to the emulator \"Hey you! Pretend to be a computer connected to a disk which contains this stuff!\"\nTo do this, he gave us a shell script which saves us time on this ./run_qemu {testcaseName}. This runs make on our behalf. Debugging can be helped by reducing the optimization flag\nThe 3 stars will indicate lines which should be considered as part of the output and thus be graded so we can do debugging.\nPrinting with SAY(..) means that output will be detected for correctness\nPrinting with kprint will make our output not be recognized for correctness\nis there a way to make it so that our program only runs once despite the number of cores?\nWell, we haven't invented threads yet. To have parallelism\nWhen things aren't working, it's a good idea to set the number of cores to 1 to identify if we have a concurrency issue. he made it so SAY runs in the critical section. Say will break parallelism but maintain concurrency. Things will try to run in parallelism if you don't stop them.Wait how do I stop someone else from running a path of code at the same time?KPANIC is like kprint, you're giving up, and it prints an error message and then shuts down the system. It doesn't run in a critical section. How do I tell the other cores that they can't run SAY\nThere's a mutual exclusion policyu. The fact that I'm speaking stops others from speaing. There are mechanisms for doing that. One is called a \"spin lock\". That's a flag. If it's false, you're welcome to go, if it's true you can't. But what if we hit the flag at the same time? Race condition! We want that operation to be \"atomic\". Meaning, it's indivisible. We want to have an operation that says \"check the value and set it to one without anyone interfering with me\". Architectures have ways to do this. \"change in x96\" does this. By carefully using atomic operations, you can implement those critical sections. He has a file called atomic.h full of nice C++ classes, one is called \"spin-lock\": which gives us a way to sue those mechanisms. You don't want to think about this in every line of code, most of the time you're not sharing anything with anyone. It's only when you do any sharing do you need to do any managing. We only have one format string : ?. The compiler can then figure that al out at compile time.\nAs a note though, the kernel will only want to print hex inside SAY. To have it print in decimal, wrap your number in the function Dec(num).What happens with a counter though?

Because we're trying to access something shared, when that occurs we want to temporarily break parallelism. Try and break parallelism for as little time as possible. We're always better off not using anything Atomic at all. If you use a lock, the spin lock is sitting in a lop trying to access the variable which isn't great, but next week will invent a better kind of lock.We still haven't gotten things to print out in the correct order though. This is the use of the spin lock. We want to combine the incrementing of the value, with printing it. The spin lock fixes the printing conflict, the atomic fixes the segmentation fault from the simultaneous access. In our case, we can abandon atomic.\nWe instantiate an object of a spinlock, lock the lock, increment the count, and unlock the lock. Idealty we don't nest locking though. That can lead to all sorts of bad scenarios, including a deadlock. Example 1.2.1 (Deadlock).\nI'm holding lock A, and you're holding lock B. You want to get A, you want to get B. Well now no one can get anything. It'll never end\nIf i want things to be different baed on the different internal ID, does the parallelism need to be broken for the entirety I need to reference that core ID?\nYes! The easier way to work around that is to implement a switch. That way parallelism is broken for as little as possible The kernel needs to have a heap, so he will give us an incomplete heap implementation. It will have malloc, but not have free. The reason he's givign us that is two-fold:\nThe heap is magical, and he wants us to see how the heap is realized and comes form\nWe only have one heap, but we have four cores competing for the heap, so they can't malloc or free at the same time. We need to somehow sort that out. Probably a spin-lock, but it's about finding the right place.\nThen just write your own test case\nmake -s will make things quieter\nTo check if your test case passed, each test case has their own 'ok' file which is the correct output (for the things with stars in front of them)\ntestname.cc is code\ntestname.ok is the correct output\nBOTH OF THE ABOVE NEED TO BE MADE ONCE BY ME AS I WRITE\ntestname.out is the output to see if it was correct\ntestname.raw is the raw output with all the debug information, not just the ones with stars\ntestname.time tells you how long it took to run. (The grading system looks at this to see how long it takes to run and all of that) While we're doing this, we should run qemu. The boot loader is driven by a config file, which tells the boot loader what to do. That config file sits in the root directory. Most of the time we have no need to change it.\nIf you're debugging and want to experiment with different kernels, we can edit that in the config file! That would be convenient.\nOnce the boot loader starts running, to tries to load the kernel executable into memory, it needs to have an entrypoint.\nThat is the system_main.cc file, it is the entrypoint. There's exactly one core running at this point. This is a boot loader dictated rule. You need to nudge them to make them wake up. At the beginning, the system is completely uninitialized. If you cal malloc before initializing the heap, all bets are off. The core before malloc is carefully written to avoid calling malloc. (Line 82 of system_main.cc)After that, the global constructors. If you have any global variable with a constructor, you put it in the chunks line 88. Strategically placed after initializing the heap (because those constructors might use the heap).

Print statement debugging will be helpful in this class. If you don't exit gdb when you are done, the process will be kept alive and I can't Volatile operations come from a flaw in compiler optimization, where sequential instructions with the same value are cached before going back to storing.\nThe issue is that if I have multiple cores, not sending the value back frequently might make it so that it has mutated since, but the parallelism is overwritten by each core. One core might pull an earlier instance of a variable with no work yet done on it\nHe says this is a common thing as a bug so to watch out for it\nCore speeds are non-deterministic\nThe volatile keyword will introduce those extra load and store commands to entire that our cores sync more often\nAs a code example\n1#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;2int main() {3int hi = 4;4 hi++;5 hi--;6}The above compiles to1main:2 movs r0, #03 bx lrCompare this to volatile, which keeps the loads and stores1#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;2int main() {3volatile int hi = 4;4 hi++;5 hi--;6}71main:2 sub sp, sp, #83 movs r3, #44 str r3, [sp, #4]5 ldr r3, [sp, #4]6 adds r3, r3, #17 str r3, [sp, #4]8 ldr r3, [sp, #4]9 subs r3, r3, #110 str r3, [sp, #4]11 movs r0, #012 add sp, sp, #813 bx lrThis still won't solve all the problems. To fix it, we require a stronger condition. Think about it as an atomic operation which guarantees that our operations happen without any interruptions. Atomics make sure that nothing else is capable of in parallel executing an operation on a given point in data.\nYou're still not protected from atomics happening in different atomics happening out of order. You're only promised it will be executed eventually and not parallel.\nAtomics don't block normal operations, they block other atomic operations.\nAtomics have a max size they can operate on, so it wont work for massive data structures. It's a 64bit max, so you'd need to break up the data structure. uint64 is a good default datatype.

There's a sequential dependency between the load and the add instructions. Nothing we can do should change that. Notice that there's no dependency arrows between both of the cores. Nothing says that one instruction has to be run before or after another between cores.\nBecause of this lack of explicit dependency, nothing has promised that our cores executed. When a program is nondeterministic, it generates an \"answer set\". In this case, it's . IFWe do promise that if the are \"naturally aligned\". we will only get one or the other possible answersx86 has an accumulator style instruction set, so many instructions only have two operands.\nBy having a simpler command logic for x86, we just shift the command logic to the fetch and decode cycle, as it's now way more complicated for them, where in ARM it's spelled out. We can add prefixes to instructions in x86, one called the lock prefix. When you do that, you ask the hardware to do this instruction atomically. This guarantees that only that instruction is run atomically. How the fuck do you decode a variable length instruction? It's just hardware at that point How do I know if. feature is apart of a compiler directive?The most obvious choice for in our higher language flagging our code, is a flag (maybe a bool). 1int x = ...;2bool b_is_busy = false;Then when someone is accessing x, we stop it.\nWhile x_is_busy, we do nothing (that's called spinning). The process will have some trouble with a branch predictor though. The branch predictors IRL are smart, and it'll aggressively keep predicting that we keep taking the while loop.\nrevving. Always put stuckinaloop if we're stuck in a loop and waiting for a process to finishOur race condition switches from being on x to being on the flag, as now the flag is the shared resource.

In the core is another value. This method will atomically swap the two elements. Now thanks to atomic exchange we're safe! Won't going out to memory slow down our current core, and thus make us slip out of phase?\nWe don't mind that here since we have locking functional!\nThis pattern where1while(_atomic_exchange(&amp;var_is_busy,true)){2\tstuckInaLoop3\t}4x=x+1;5x_is_busy = false;C++ has a nice thing where we get \"zero cost\" abstractions. At runtime all this overhead disappearsCan we reference our old MM Lab implementation for this assignment?There's a lot of good information out there, and a lot more bad information\nOn the memory bus, there used to be exactly one wire on it called \"lock\". in 1981 if you're doing a load or just an add, if you put the atomic prefix in front of it, one core would set hte lock line on a 1. Then any other core would look at the lockline and if it was 1, it would not access any memory until the line was zero.The answer to how the modern system works is related to how caches are structured. We want to keep our L1's separate, because their efficiency is associated to how tightly connected it is to the core\nA write-through won't save us here, early on this is what stopped people from having multiprocessors and shared memories. Caches were thought to be the death of multiprocessing.\nThe solution is to have a cache coherence protocol.\nSome way of building the system so we don't allow the caches to disagree with each other. This is what gets implemented in personal computing systems.\nThe solution is a snoopy busBut what makes the snoopy bus faster? Well we want to minimize the number of messages communicated over the channel.\nWe also need to filter traffic and only sent the bare minimum needed to send. That means we have to keep more state within the cache. This is the MSI protocol. Each cache block can be in 1 of three states within a cache. We check if the block is in the modified state, or the invalid state When two people are reading x, they will see it's in the shared state\nBelow is a line by line diagram for how the snoopy bus works!But then how do we add atomicity? One of the ways to achieve this, is to introduce another state, called the a state for atomicStick volatile in front of variables that I think will be shared, but are not atomic.

Threads are purely a software concept constructed by the OS to implement concurrencyA good test case doesn't just tell you that you failed, it gives you instructive information\nThe report isn't the type of thing you want to do last minute. By answering the questions in the report you can do the assignment betterWhat we have so far is that we have more comprehensive bootstraping, there's a spot in system main which runs global initialization, calls core main to run all the cores.\nWe got an incomplete heap implementation m but he wants to get to know us\nWith the heap, we can now use our first abstraction. Ideally our first abstraction is the ability to abstract away from the cores.A thread is a pure software concept. We hear about hardware threads a lot, but we will call the core a unit of parallelism. The threads are units of concurrencyHardware threads -&gt; Things that can run in parallel physically\nSoftware Threads -&gt; Units of concurrencyIn the next assignment, we'll see that kernel_main() will be called by exactly one of the cores. It runs exactly one activity, or exactly one thread.\nThe other cores are inside an event loop, waiting for something to happen so that they can do it. Once a thread is accessible, they grab it!We're waiting for the one thing running to create a new thread! We need the mechanism to create a second thread\nWe're gonna add a function which somehow, dispatches a new thread. That means.We want to give a piece of work to another port of software to be forked on.\nBut how do we tell the thread what to work on? Well we can pass inside a function pointer. 1kernel_main(){2\t...3\tthread(f)4\t...5}6void f(){7\t...8\t...9}10/But then what is the type of the function pointer?1void thread (void (*p)()){2\t...3\t...4}We're gonna implement thread together! We need to implement the thread function so that code is handed out to the other cores.\nIn general whenever we have a data-structure which describes something, we call it a thread control block (TDB). File is file control block FCB. Work...........f()TCB is gonna be a box with p inside of it, some kind of structure. Now we need to find a way to issue it to a core.\nThe event loop is the code running inside a core which allows it to sit there and look for something.\nWe will refer to this as the ready-queue. It doesn't have to be a FIFO queue necessarily, but it's always the best way to start.\nWe call FIFO queue round robin scheduling. If the cores aren't ready, we just put our current item at the end of the list and check the next one up.header ofqueueTCPTCPTCP\nThe event loop just grabs the next thing in the queue and updates it.\nWe need to have some way to protect the ready queue with like a spin lock or atomic.\nEvery time you have a mutable global data structure, you need to think about race conditions.1void thread (void (*p)()){2\t...3\ttcb = new box{p}4\treadyq.add(tbc)5\t...6}This function returns really quickly and f runs pretty quickly concurrent to whoever called f. How do we make our functions process inputs and produce outputs?\nOh well invention time\nWe're going to invent operative threads. They are threads that are well behaved, who don't hog the CPU. Like what if someone had a while loop that never ends? The OS will give a program a millisecond to finish, then if it doesn't it'll move away for some time before coming back\nWe want to figure out how to implement imstuckinaloop(). We don't want to enter the function from the start, and we want it to be suck that, when we run it, we save the state of the thread in such a way that when someone wants to come back to the work they can start where we left with the state of the variables.\nWe need to keep track of where we stopped, where the PC was at returning, teh values of all the registers, the local variables values.\nWe don't need to preserve our local variables. By that point we assert that all threads share global variables\nWe have to have this as a dynamically sized struct too. Everything we need to save is either in a register, or on a stack. If we can push them all on the stack, all we need to do is preserve the state of the stack!\nIf you don't want to pass things around or move them around, you can have a dedicated stack for each thread. Each thread will get it's own stack! Then to save your context you just push your registers to your stack. Then the stack pointer for our current stack state gets tossed in the TCB, and the state is preserved.\nBut like what if the stack gets really big? Like if there's no contiguous block in memory we can use?\nOh dummy the stack grows inward not outward\nWe're gonna write pieces of the code for this together!\nWe want to find out if there's some other thread that is ready to run, but is not running. And if such a thing exists, we want to give it a chance to run!Everytime you find yourself observing a data structure and then modifying a state based on that observation, danger. The structure can mutate in between your steps. Read-Modify-Write is DANGEROUS with a shared data structure. You need to worry about race conditionsThe easiest thing is to never really ask if it's empty and then get the element.

It is a two operand architectureThe assembly for x86 is weird because the destination is on the right, not the left.\nThe most general addressing mode is (in the ATT syntax) very complex. We get some segment register fs (optional), with a displacementEffective Address = fsbase+displacement+reg(b)base+reg(i)*scaleIf we put no segment register, then it'll work implicitly\nWe use index and scale for array indexing.

That's be cause typically the prologue in saving will save pairs of registers.x86 says before you call a function, the SP has to be divisible by 16x68 has a call instruction. It doesn't have a link register. The call instruction will instead push it on the stack over saving the link register. This is just doing the saving on our behalf.\nCall subtracts 8 from SP\nThe return instruction will then instead pop our value from the stack then return. This adds 8 from SP\nJust make sure the stack pointer is 16 byte aligned before calling the function, and then the compiler will handle the alignment issues since it knows what it'll cause.

Well we don't care! It can be anything, as long as we survive the sequential pop'ing 6 times.\nBut what do we want the brand new thread to do for the return register? Put the pointer for func so that we return to it/call it. But now what happens when the function returns? The thread should terminateWhat we're thinking instead is to define another function which does the thread entry logic, and then stops the thread for us1[[noreturn]] thread.entry(){2\ttcb *me = (TCB) readfsbase()3\tASSERT(me!=null);4\tASSERT(me.self == me);5\t//sanity check on the TCB given a sentinel we know should exist6\t//stackpointer shouidl point in the middle fo where our stack is7\t//really difficult to debug these things, so it's really good to do this8\tfunc();9\tThread::stop10\t}This is also a great place to debug things and put breakpoints! But how do we know what the function is if we can't take an input? Well from our diagram we can just read fsbase and then find the function pointer.\nEverywhere we read from fsbase, we need to deal with it in a special way since we could be a bootstrapping functionIs there a way that we can wrap that extra logic in a macro or a function? Do not force ourself to do things the way he does them. Other techniques might make more sense to me. We need to update the constructor of TCB to do the right things, like make that function wrapper for entry, fill the last 6 elements in the stack, etc.\nThe noreturn instructions are very important since it helps use our compiler to debug\ntwo ways of making things stop in this world, we just have to call the shutdown function somewhere in your test. This wont always work, since you can't edit tests.\nThe other assignment requirement is that if the system gets itself in a state with no threads that have any hope of running in the future, it should auto shutdown. What does no hope mean? In p3 we're implementing a sleep function which might be too long, that's no hope Do we know have to implement that check? No it's with the coming assignment We have to check for leaks in the heap, and tests will check for that.

That leads to lambdas and thread local variables!\nMost of my notes today were done in the projectEvery context swutchi might start from the entry, or right from the middle. if we try to do anything after switching contacts, we have to do it at the beginning if its starting or the end.\nswitch_context has to be identical in to those in entry, then we do the post.switch() tasks. We do whatever we want after the switch (check for stack overflow, etc)We have to implement thread local storage, but it's considered an advanced feature. None of the testcases use them, but we might do it and then implement a testcase for it.\nGlobal variable int a=10 There is another modifier which lets us keep a variable confined to a given thread. If you put threadlocal, it has infinite lifetime, but there's a unique copy of it for each possible thread in the system. Each thread gets it's own copy of a. Then the threads can use that to store private data. The compiler uses negative offsets from fsbase to get to our tls variables\nEvery-time we make a thread we need to copy the values from the global variables to the tls areaIf you want to make a thread, you say Thread::create(f). The function needs an environment to run in to give copies of maybe contextual variables or input parameters. A closure is a function+environment. A closure is a pointer to a piece of code, plus some environment (plus a bunch of variables) which need to be available to the function 1Thread::create([ ]{2\t//code3\t//kprint, SAY, etc4\t5})6The advantage of this is that we can also keep the function anonymous\nLet's say we want to make the threads in a loop!1for(i=0;i&lt;1e10000;i++){2\tThread::create([i]{3 // this makes a COPY of i4 //code5 //kprint, SAY, etc6 SAY(\"thread is here?\\n\",i);7\t})8\t// can the thread access something in it's environment??9\t// the default C++ behaviro is that we have to list everything we're caching in brackets10}11The compiler generates this data structure for us!\nSmarter to focus on closures and lambdas over MM stuff.

To get the divergence of our vectorA non-zero divergence is equivalent to to having field aligned divergences and the direction of the flow changes outward. A divergence can be zero if the two terms compensate for each other. The strength changes, but the field spreads out and then comes back in. This is why divergence is a scalar product! It explains variations on a field form all directions.Question\nCan you really product rule in this way? The divergence operator feels different from the gradient operator\nWhat does it mean to take. the gradient of a scalar?\nthe magnitude. isa multivariable function so we just take the gradient as we would normally.\nExample 1.3.2 (Find the divergence of ).\nThe divergence has a first term of zero, and the field is anti-aligned across the component's axis which. is also zero.

To do this, recall the following conversion identities I'm actually crashing out getting a name wrong is so embarrassing I swear I was just thinking about girl day To solve it into spherical coordinates, you use these identities to solve for the angles.

If there are charges inside, then the flux changes according to <a data-href=\"#^50c460\" href=\"#^50c460\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">^50c460</a><a data-href=\"#^50c460\" href=\"#^50c460\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Definition 1.8.3 (Gauss' Law)</a> Definition 1.8.3 (Gauss' Law).\nThe net flux of the electrostatic field in a vacuum, is Our flux is directly proportional to our enclosed charge. Gauss' Law is fundamental to electrostatics.\n4. It allows us to determine the electric field for a given electric field when there is a nice symmetry, via a distribution of charge. Why's the symmetry important? well once you've identified the symmetry, you can exploit that symmetry when calculating your electric field.\n- You might have spherical symmetry. In that case, when applying Gauss' Law we know that the electric field is solely proportional to the radius since flux is preserved.\n- With cylindrical symmetry, your gaussian surface is coaxial cylinders\n- With infinite planes your gaussian surface is a pillbox which straddles the surface. Like a cylinder perpendicular to the surface and through.\n- [0] Wow it really is a straight up called a pillbox colloquiallyAfter class.U should look into the doctors appointment because I keep forgetting. Prob wanna make my stress listNo crashouts this timeExample 1.8.4 (Let's say you have a sphere with a charge distribution on the surface. How do we get the electric field outside?).\nMake a gaussian surface outside the sphere, with a radius The flux at our second point is For the flux inside the sphere, the electric field can still only be radially dependent. In this problem, the electric field has to be zero inside.\nNOTE: Zero flux doesn't imply no electric field. We can have a source and a drain.\nWhat happens when we make the sphere dense? This just changes a piecewise condition on the interior, since the charge now scales against the radius. If you work it out, the field increases linearly as you increase the radius until you exit the sphere and then it drops by . Remember though that in this case, we'd need to perform a volume integral to get the enclosed charge in a sphere.

This is useful when Alice doesn't know\nWhy must the below inequalities be true? $$ If I have a teleportation protocol implemented, and I have a qubit. Alice has a time evolving unitary which rotates the qubit along the plane, Bob starts with a time evolving unitary rotating it in the plane. Alice prepares and sends the qubit information to Bob, while they both have their initial unitaries. At the moment of sending, Alice uses a classical channel to tell bob to switch his Unitary. Bob starts using for his Unitary rotation when the qubit teleports, but before he receives Alice's measurement data and applies it. Which unitary has the influence on the final state? Can't we say that the identity of the qubit, is with whomsoever has an acting Unitary? Like we can send multiple qubits at known states , and perform QST at Bob.

So far this just feels like a funky particleDefinition 1.4.1 (Matrix representation of the Pauli Matricies).\nThe below representation are in the diagonalized basis There's also the CC-Not, the Toffoli gate (Page 31 in the textbook). This is an 8x8 matrix, which behaves just like an AND gate using the two input bits.Note that this is different than , because unitaries MUST be reversible. That means you can't just destroy information (unless you measure).Exercise 1.4.1 (Assume you have the state ).\nWhat happens if you measure both states at the same time? But now what happens when you measure them one after the other? We're going to measure the first qubit. What the new state of the second qubit is, then affects what the output of the first qubit is. What happens if I measure the first qubit in a different basis that isn't the digital basis? I think you just rewrite the basis of the first qubit into the new basis, write the possible states after measurement, then use that to determine your results.\nThat or you just apply the measurement observables to the qubit you're going to measure, then work from there.\nI think entanglement finally made sense in my headDefinition 1.4.2 (Watched Pot Effect). Let's say we have a vector , and we have our qubit naturally drifting from the zero to the one state. If we're an experimentalist, we want to know this is happening, so we keep watching the qubit, waiting for it to drift.\nLet's say the qubit rotates by radians. Nature applies the below unitary to the qubit continuously The experimenter will never see the qubit rotate! Without the measurements, the qubit would be rotating. That being said, the experimenter measures discretely, which means Squaring from the already low probability, means the probability of the qubit snapping to one is astonishingly small.\nIf we measure consistently over time and is linear, we make measurements. That means over one rotation, the probability of snapping to 1 becomes Definition 1.4.3 (Zeno's Effect).\nGiven a qubit now locked at , and I want to somehow convert it to a qubit with no gates. To do that, I can apply measuring in infinite basis with angle.

There are things in real life we don't want copied, like SSN's.Given a coin, our job is to find if it's a fair coin or biasedIn stats, we'd just flip the coin a crap ton, and then use a confidence test on the mean to know if we're within valid range.How many times do we need to flip the coin to determine the value of to some confidence?But how much memory do we need?\nNeed to remember the number of flips, the number of heads-tails\nNaive strategy is writing out the whole string of information, which takes bits.\nIf we just store the two integers of number of runs, and number of tails, it's . This is just because we're representing information in base 2. To represent in base 2, the number of bits is the natural log.\nWhat if we instead built a FSM, where one heads moves right, tails goes left, and halts at a bound. If it's fair, then we should land on heads and tails at the boundary equally. If it's even slightly skewed, it would bias the halting far more.\nHellman-Cover 1970 proved this is optimal\nCan we find a way to record the information in a single qubit?\nThe qubit becomes an analog counter. Repeat N = times Does this not smuggle in a counter to keep track&gt; It does! But how do we avoid this? See step 3!

Don't you need several runs to get a confidence interval?\nThe idea is that is the number where the tail ends of the normal distributions are far enough apart, that one measurement has the confidence baked in.\nTheorem 1.5.1 (No Cloning Theorem).\nGiven a qubit , there is no operator which will produce two copies of the state. The above is impossible. We can't apply an operator to any qubit system to duplicate a state Given two vectors In our copying case below, this means our expected value is then For the same unitary and vectors, the transformation can't change the inner product. Unless unless . Nothing in quantum-mechanics increases inner-productsIf given and you KNOW , nothing stops you from cloning. You can just find some one-qubit unitary and make a factory.\nWhat it does say, is that if you don't know this you can't make the double.This literally makes us a bell-state, which means a measurement of one qubit is a measurement of another. Invented by Steven Wiesner, who was the son of JFK's science advisor. Br. wrote a paper on this, submitted it and they rejected it. Instead of coping and rewriting, the guy LEFT PHYSICS became a manual laborer, and waited till 1983.His idea was, if quantum states really have this one-off measurement, there are two points of view. It sucks, we're limited in our view of the world\nIRL there are a bunch of things that we don't want to be copied, LIKE CASH.

The interface is so intuitive, and I would have really appreciated a tool like this when i was first learning about quantum optics. A personal project of mine has been to make websites demonstrating different physical phenomena, and coming up with a good pedagogy to use when writing websites for quantum behaviors has been something I've struggled with. I was wondering if you could point me in the direction of any papers that helped motivate the creation of the site? Quantumflytrap has such a high level of polish, and I'd love to learn how to make similar tools.\nI've attached my resume which includes my quantum-optics experience if that helps.\nHope you're doing well, and thank you so much for your time!\nSincerely,\nAzal Amer (he/him) The goal is that Alice randomly selects a basis to prepare her signal in, and then inside that basis the orthogonal axis are labelled 0,1.

Definition 1.13.2 (LOCC).\nLocal Operations, Classical Communication\nTo increase the entropy of entanglement, at some point a qubit has to pass between Alice and Bob, which means you can only re-entangle Alice and Bob with quantum information or operations.What happens when we have a mixed state between to possible entangled statesTHIS STATE IS NOT ENTANGLED\nTheres an equal probability to and , which means that we can only derive information from <a data-href=\"#^unentangledDensityMatrix\" href=\"#^unentangledDensityMatrix\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">^unentangledDensityMatrix</a><a data-href=\"#^unentangledDensityMatrix\" href=\"#^unentangledDensityMatrix\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">(1.13.6)</a>\nA mixed state is unentangled, if it can be written as a mixture of product states.What aboutIs it possible to write this density matrix, as a mixture of product states?\nYES!Determining if a mixed state is entangled, is NP-Hard. <br>Definition 1.13.3 (NP-Hard).\nAny problem which is at least as hard, as the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"../../../../Miscillaneous/Tidbit Facts/Satisfiability Problem\" data-href=\"../../../../Miscillaneous/Tidbit Facts/Satisfiability Problem\" href=\"school/miscillaneous/tidbit-facts/satisfiability-problem.html\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">Satisfiability Problem</a><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"../../../../Miscillaneous/Tidbit Facts/Satisfiability Problem\" data-href=\"../../../../Miscillaneous/Tidbit Facts/Satisfiability Problem\" href=\"school/miscillaneous/tidbit-facts/satisfiability-problem.html\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Satisfiability Problem</a> with a polynomial addition. If Alice and Bob both have spaces of size , then the density matrix can only be written in combinations.All forms of physics have their own interpretations drawn from the math, but quantum mechanics has a unique problem: measurement.Definition 1.13.4 (Measurement Problem).\nHow can you have both Unitary transformations, which are time-reversible, and measurement, in the same universe? How does nature when to suspend the first rule, and apply the second?\nIs the problem Physics, or philosophy?\nWe can get molecules large enough to Carbon-60, to perform the double slit experiment and be in super-position.\nThe way that people approach solving this problem is through 4 possible interpretations:Comes from the city which QM generally originated from.Definition 1.13.5 (Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics).\nThere is this micro-world which obeys unitary evolution, but we live in the macro-world with probabilistic experiences. Measurement is the macro-world reaching in and interrogating the micro-world.\nThere is some boundary between the macro, and the micro\nThe obvious response, is why should there be a boundary. It's where Schr칬dinger's cat comes from. Why can't a macroscopic object be in a superposition.

Whole philosophy of <a href=\".?query=tag:instrumentalism\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#instrumentalism\">#instrumentalism</a>. The underlying idea is that the goal of sciecne, is to predict the outcome of experiments. If you're not happy with that, the problem isn't with QM, but with you.Definition 1.13.6 (Wigner's Friend Thought experiment.).\nImagine yourself in a thought experiment as a superposition between two thoughts Wigner might feel like he's already made a decision, but then a friend comes along and measures in the basis. To , Wigner never made a decision at all. There was no measurement\nThen World War 2 happened, and got distracted by like, war, so this became pretty stupid. But then 1950's Hugh Everett, a grad student at Princeton (student of Wheeler), had another ideaThe Unitary Evolution Only picture- \"What if we take unitary operations literally?\"During a measurement, there must be some physical interaction between a qubit, and a measuring device , and then you . Measurement if you think about it, acts like a CNOT between the qubit and the measuring apparatus. They get entangled. Interaction becomes entanglement.The superposition initially confined to on electron or state, has now spread.\nIn principle though, everything that has happened is still reversible. You applied a unitary transformation to get down there, then you can undo it.\nBut practically, you don't have control over all the degrees of freedom involved. You can't exert the dagger operation on every single propagation. You'd need to decrease the entropy of the quantum state.\nThat's why measurements are irreversible in practice.BUT WHAT ABOUT ME?? I still need to perceive the outcome, or what good is the measurement device?This is where Everett bites a crazy bulletThere is nothing in the Unitary evolution law that says one of the branches. But why don't we perceive the either branch? Well you only exist in the one branch. Once the branches have split off, they keep having a time-evolving unitary kick off and break them out more.<br>But if they split off into two, what happens to ?\nWhere did these specific probabilities come from?

There is nothing so primitive as measurement, but then it adds a hidden variable.\nDefinition (Bohmian Mechanics).\nEssentially a particle in superposition has some \"real\" location, which is simply guided by the behavior of the superposition. For this to work, we need a rule on how the \"guiding\" works. The rule must have the property that if anyone does measure the particle, they'll see what QM predicted for it.

Another way to get to is if we say that we do have some classical algorithm which checks a singular row, and we apply it to the superposition of rows. Within each Grover iteration, we have to make queries. We apply grover to this, times Instead of the classical algorithm checker, we can replace it with another Grover's algorithm. We have an outer Grover loop, and an inner Grover loop. Our outer Grover runs by , and our outer grover also runs . Therefore, we've reduced our search time to !\nThe inner loop runs over all the columns, and searches for a zero. Then the outer loop runs over all those results, looking for a 1.\nWith the above, you need to consider the error building in the inner loop, which initially people thoguht would make you have , but later it was proved to just be What about arrays This is really useful for games! You can represent games as decision trees. Let's say you have some range of the board, and you want to know what the path is to your victory. You search the leaf nodes for where you can have success. Then you search for one level before the final move. What positions were there? Then repeat that until you reach the current state.\nThese are called Games of Alternation. This is how ML models used to work, it's how Deep Blue beat the best chess player in the world.What if we try Grover-ing this? Well we'd get a crap load of error propagation, so we have to keep amplifying. It doesn't take long in that proves that the Grover speedup vanishes.\n(Additionally, we assume that there exists some oracle which can tell us if the board has been won)\nThe calculation of showing the error, is that to be sufficient for our probability amplitudes, we know that we need runs. Additionally, we need to uncompute, so multiply by 2. That gives us . , so these factors build up and keep making the runtime bigger.\nBecause of this, it was conjectured that there was no speedup with Grover.Theorem 2.9.3 (Forhi,Goldstone, Gutmonn (2007):). some algorithm which always runs any decision tree , where is the number of leaves at the end of the node<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702144\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702144\" target=\"_self\">Source</a> Their algorithm was contingent on their experience as particle physicists.\nBecause of this, Chess might actually be totally solvable.

(I did ask this in FRI, but I think there wasn't good time to get into it)\nIn the real world, all the extra syndrome qubits are also evolving their own error. By keeping everything it's a bit like how the qubits are in a superposition of being in a superposition of an error or not. By measuring, we force nature to make up it's mind. This forces the hand of nature. Quote\nA man calls 911 and says \"Help! I think my friend is dead!\"\nThe operator says \"Okay, first make sure he's really dead.\"\nBANG\nThe man gets back on the phone and says \"Okay, now what?\"\nThis code represented into the explosion of a whole new world of theory.\nWe went from 9-qubits-&gt;7 qubits -&gt; 5-QubitsPeople learned how to generalize this, and give quantum analogs for just about anything. We can design codes to protect against multiple errors and everything using stabilizers.How would I then CNOT a logical qubit? Do I just put the node on the original physical qubit?A big question is \"How can we implement a quantum computer which implements the identity operator\"With classical computers, back in the 1950's there were people saying that classical computers were never going to get big.\nThis talk provoked John Von-Neumann into proving a theoremTheorem 2.11.1 (Von Neumann (1950): You can build an arbitrary reliable circuit from unreliable AND,OR,NOT gates as long as:). the failure probabilities are independent\nBelow some constant failure probability The easiest solution is just having a repetition code with a majority vote But to compute the majority of different bits, then I need a circuit! You might just keep making things worse and worse. While that tree does look exponential, he also proved that the overhead to correct bits, then We want our physical error rate to be below this linear trend. We want it to be a net win to physically correct. VonNeumann showed that this function is actually a non-linear function!\nTragically, right after this we got the transistor which basically never fails. Then the field came to a screeching halt. This is what gets us Quantum Fault-Tolerance! This was an incredibly fast jump.Theorem 2.11.2 (Threshold Theorem Aharanov &amp; Ben-Or 1996 , Zurek,...). s.t can do an arbitrary reliable quantum computation, even if at every qubit, at every time needed to apply one gate (time-step), suffers from independent noise . Assume you can perform measurements in the middle of the computation and react to them We can perform extremely fast, errorless classical computation This in particular is a bit of a challenge! The quantum-errors happen in nanoseconds We have plenty of fresh qubits that we can utilize. Used in the event that we need to throw something out We can perform parallel operations Meaning I can perform gates on all the qubits at the same time. This is needed because we're assuming errors can happen everywhere in parallel What all of this mean thermodynamically, is that our quantum-computer is now an open system which generates heat. \"If nature was a demon, and went HMM I wanna pick 1% of errors to screw with, that kills this\" No one knows how to do QC fault tolerance in the face of correlated noise Gil Kalai is a famous mathematician who insists that the independence of errors is a damming assumption. 5 years ago, Google implemented a circuit Aaronson and his student proposed in 2011.\nThey applied 1000 random gates to those 50, then measured. They did a bunch of shots.\nusing a classical supercomputer, you can calculate what the probability of any output should have been.\nWhoops a few years later, people improved the classical algorithm and denied it\nThis is a two-sided fight, quantum did it too Tragically, we did make a claim that we found something supremacy, but to prove it we need unlimited memory. Without it, we'd need years, which means we can't actually prove it.\nThe most useful thing we learned from the Google experiment, was thanks to the independence of errors. Because every gate is subject to constant noise, the final state should be close to the maximally mixed state . The data then gives us a density matrix ofWith enough shots, you can recover In Google's original experiment, . 99% of their stuff was garbageWhat Google found was that (Where ) is the number of gates. The error is proportional to the number of gates!

Google, Microsoft, and blah blah are now all investing billions is that these numbers have finally collided. A few months ago, Google did an experiment with 103 qubits and a few thousand gates. As they increased the size of the code-word, and the code-distance, the logical qubit stays alive for longer and longer. Going to a bigger code survives for longer. This implies that error was going down! By some remarks, Google has made the first error-correcting qubit.I'm getting a journalist calling me everyday and I'm like \"yeah it's good!\"Internally their definition of a logical qubit is if they can do operations on it, which means an error rate of .Pr.

A bunch of companies are hedging their bets in different places, with no obvious winner\nSuperconducting qubits basically use currents in superposition of two directions. The chips themselves are filled with relatively huge qubits. The chip looks like a normal chip, with wires feeding into classical control electronics Each qubit can do a 2-qubit operation on it's neighbor. The advantage is that they are fast as hell, and they can use standard fabrication techniques\nDisad; Qubits are fixed in place\nHow would I go about doing a non-local operation if you can only work with neighbors?\nYou'd have to use CSWAP on each qubit along the road Well then how do you get parallelism if every qubit needs to be subsequently teleported\nWith a lot of difficulty and layers Fixed ion Computing : Literally atomically sixed with Ytterbium nuclei, and you're manipulating their spin. Moving them close to each other has a Columb interaction you can use to engineer a gate This is incredibly slow (1000x slower than superconducting), but you can move the qubits around (Quantinium, IonQ) Neutral Atoms : QuEra, Atom Computing (Up to 400 qubits)\nPhotonics: PsiQuantum (#1 billion in venture capital, but they did no demos), Xandu So they're shooting for the moon without like, any intermediate\nPhotons have incredibly good coherence. The issue is getting two photons to interact. Do they not need to worry about error correctipn then?\nTheir measurements then entangle two photons, but doing their measurements then induce errors.

In the Stern Gerlach, we only care about the z-component. So we rewrite toFrom our formula of a moving charge in a magnetic field, we can calculate as We then substitute these units into the above expression, to getTherefore, spin has the units of angular momentum\n郊멙rom the experiment it tells us thatBecause both sides must be identical, has to have angular momentum Theorem 1.2.3 (). Which has units of , Angular momentum has units of Energy*time, so the above means that planks constant measures angular momentum\nImagine we're back at the experiment, and at the beam deflecting up or down, we put an orthogonal magnetic field afterward. We then write asThe state written in the state, is a combination of the states of the observable. But what are the values of Substituting in our expression for to the measured identity, we getWe know that is orthogonal to , so it's inner product is zeroNow we do the same with , to get the same thingWe add the complex component to represent some unknown phase which transformed the vectors.For notation purposes, we're just redefining to throw out the complex phase for The same steps get repeated, in the same fashion for to get us the pair of states. Note that we have to prove the identity later for the phase, since only loops in For notation now, we're going to redefine to include that constant Are still orthogonal if we wrap that phase in?\nYep! See the below diagram Keep in mind that we've rotated in a complex component, but it's still orthogonal. To a vector in multiple spaces, there is a whole plane which is orthogonal.

What's the observable for this?\nI think given the implied orientation of the experiment, it would be the observable, as the charge would move parallel to the magnetic field lines. Because we can represent this as a pure state, we know that there is an observable where it is an eigenvector.\nNow the question is, how can we gather more information from this system?How do we find ?

In advance of class we were told to read Griffiths Chapter 10.1 Perturbation theory and first order.Perturbation is like a brand new car with a flat tire. We want to fix the tire, not throw out the car.With perturbation theory, how can we explicitly charecterize the associated error given the relative magnitude of the perturbation? In quantum 1, Professor Fischler mentioned that epsilon had to be small within the boundary, but is it possible to see how the error for a fixed order approximation grows, as a function of the size of epsilon? Additionally, does higher order approximation solve that problem? For any possible epsilon, can I approximate it to n terms with arbitrary desired perturbation? (Like, does the perturbation&nbsp;have to be small, or can it be big if I'm up for more work)\nYou just personally decide what small is\nAnother good use of perturbation theory, is that you often don't know the value of the perturbation. Perturbation theory is good because it helps you work around that when you discover a perturbation, without having to throw all your work out.These are called fine structure. The hydrogen atom needs some corrections added to it to be able to predict those energies!\nDefinition 3.3.2 (Perturbation Theory).\nLet's say we have a hamiltonian, with a spectrum we know. A perturbation is something really small. Small means a distance in relation to another. If the orders of correction does not converge as you go higher, perturbation theory will not work.

We want to calculate an amplitude for QM, which needs to be probabilistic.\nOur goal is to find the amplitude for processes that takes a state from the initial to the final In QFT, we're doing this by calculating a power series expansion in terms of our constant for the amplitude The tool we're using to do this is a Feynman diagram\nIn Feynman diagrams, time goes up, they're great pictures but calculation tools. The power series part of this comes from the number of vertices inside our diagram. Inside QED, there always has to be two electrons and one photon line. Each vertex gives you an accumulated value of Exercise 1.3.1 (Come up with the rest of the 4 vertex Feynman diagrams based on Figure 1.1c in the text).

secret key between Alice and Bob. Alice prepares and sends a state in a randomly chosen basis, and Bob measures the received state in a randomly chosen basis. After the states have been sent and received, Alice and Bob communicate their basis choices classically and only save the data points where the basis choices match. The assumption is that by selecting the same basis, we will get the same confidence on which bit it is.\nRemember that the key is supposed to be secret, so the open communication between Alice and Bob simply contains the basis choices and not the secret key itself!\nThe knack here, is that if I'm eve, I've also randomly selected a basis to use. Now that I have my basis, and measurements, I cant just sift my information, because some of my basis's won't match bob and I won't have enough information to form the secret key.

To better understand the equation itself, let's break it up into a general envelope function, and an interference term. is our envelope function. This is the general interference pattern we would observe with only one slit present. As we increase the number of slits, the patterns still follow this general shape. The reason for this has to do with how constructive and destructive interference behave between waves.To explain , the interference term, first notice that it's this term that provides the higher frequency striping we see. Huygen's Principle says that each point on a wavefront, behaves as a point source for a spherical wave. As the wave crosses each slit, it behaves like a brand new spherical point source.

It's a speedy recap, so if I'm curious maybe look in other files or textbooks.\nThe Algebra section is probably worth looking more into since this is my first time seeing it properly. Homework gets released next Monday, but gets due the subsequent FridayDefinition 1.1.1 (Group (Algebra)).\nA non-empty set along with a binary operation (symbolically for us ) (taking two elements from the set in and returning another element in the set)\nA group has the following properties : Identity A singular and unique element s.t Every element has an inverse: where . Associativity , Closure : Abelian: ommutativity is not guaranteed! Example 1.1.2. Claim: This is a group. To prove this we just check if this holds. Identity 0 is the identity Inverse , Associativity this is promised in addition We might wonder if the integers with multiplication is a group. We might satisfy the second and third conditions if we can identify the first, but we'll find that we can't.\nWhat if 1 is the id? Well we have a problem with zero, as it does not work with every element in the group\nI am not concussed! I am totally acute and aware and not spacey at all!Other examples of groups: p is prime\nSet of all invertible matrices is a group\nSet of permutations on elements is a group with composition\nExercise (AT HOME: Think through why the above might be true). Definition 1.1.3 (Sub-Groups).\nA nonempty set is a subgroup of if itself is a group under the same operation Definition 1.1.4 (Cosets of a Group). If is a subgroup of . Given , the cosets of are all the sets of the form Its like vectors multiplied by scalars I think\nCosets define equivalence classesExample 1.1.5 (, ). would be all the multiples of within the integers Cosets of -- :\n- - - - - Notice that there's only 4 unique cosets! This is true all the time for cosets, that there is a finite quantity of disjoint cosets. both map to the same thing, so in this subgroup there is an equivalence between . This comes up with syndrome attraction between ECC's\nDefinition 1.1.6 (Field).\nA field is a set with two operations (which we will call here) with the properties: is a group itself with identity 0 is associative on both is distributive () has a multiplicative identity of is commutative has multiplicative inverses Some examples of the above are For reference, In all the fields we care about, all the operations would behave exactly how we expect addition and multiplication to act\nWith finite numbers of elements, people often denote a table of their operationsI will make it through an hour and a half class !Definition 1.1.7 (Vector Space).\nA set is a vector space over a field if there are maps (functions) with the following properties Scalar Multiplication: Vector Addition: , With Properties of the elements as: , With row vectors we have no defined multiplication, but we do have defined addition We're most familiar with the vector space on Example 1.1.8 ( is a vector space, where:).

Perfect codes are good from an information theoretic standpoint but not a practical one. With our previous model, we haveBoth selections from each set are finite. We care about the joint probability distributions .\n\"It's the probability that Bob receives and Alice sends \"The last two conditions are just tracing out the probabilities.\nThen to calculate the entropies in this distributionEntropies: Bob can only ever see , he looks at exactly one piece of information. Ideally Bob can decipher exactly what was based on what is. We need conditional probabilities for what is received by bob given what he was sent from Alice. Our important numbers are and We can determine these vyWe want to evaluate the quality of a channel at scrambling information based on how a code is constructed.

The number of bits we require will only depend on the information from the initial source messages\nExample 1.2.5 (Uncorrelated Channel).\nBob will select something independently from regardless of what Alice sends. Charlie is just completely tossing all the useful information. Charlie and Bob's communication is basically an independent noiseless channel, and functionally doesn't care about about Alice.

As long as we're within these bounds we can correct our code with some quantity of information.How much information will Bob gain by measuring a specific outcome from the noisy channel. Ideally it's a nontrivial quantity. Definition 1.2.7 (Mutual Information).\nHow much information Bob gains from a specific measurement/received message If I observe, for example 10 how much do I learn about the original information sent by Alice.

Yes\nWe'd like to give our information over the whole set, so Interpreting it happening as though there's no noise, This means that our information is Our quantity is actually 0!

From the picture above, we can imagine the noise radius at one codeword colliding with that of another. a good EC has my codewords far apart, but not a lot of wasted space either.

With the above diagram, mov $100, %fs-32 will. But we wanna know how big the thread local area isThe tls has a label __tls_start at the beginning, and __tls.end at the end hello. All we need to do is take the difference o f the start and the end and we get the size of the tls.\nThat's thanks to our PC pointing there\nBecause this is always aligned, we can think of it as an array of longs and just iterate over it. There might be a memcopy in machine.s. He'll share one with us\n1extern uint64 __tls.start__;2extern uint64 __tls.end__;\nThe loader script file will define this for us, so by the time we get to the program this is resolved.\nThe thing is that tlw doesn't really contain the beginning of that place, it is the beginning of that place. C will give us the 8 bytes back, but we want the address of it, so we need to use the %. Subtraction to get the size will give us the number of uint64 between them, not the number of bytes between themFreeing the tls has no given test which tests for it, but we can in our testcase do things which test for that.\nMake sure that the address of a TLS is confined to non-global memory space so that threads don't step on each other's toesThe compiler is the one who generates the threadlocal variables!\nAs long as you don't count the idlethreads on the \"is the thread running\" sequence\nWhen we start, we're already running, dress it up like a thread, and then that becomes our system thread. We just let them survive forever, and they turn into our idle threads. Those are our core-main functions. Then whenever we're running and want to switch to someone then we can switch to our idle-threads. Those threads can clear our unnecessary memory, background work, etc\nThis is our first example of something as a low priority item, with less priority over other threads. Then we get a per core thread. If I'm trying to stop, if there's someone to switch to thatt's where we go, and if there isn't then I'll switch to my core's specific idlethread, found in my core specific datastructure in gsb!\nYou can also have a reaper thread, so you put yourself in a queue of things which need to be cleaned. Then a thread running in the background has a mission in life of emptying the zombie queue\nThere's a lot of components we need to learn through. If we captured any values on our thread, anything we captured has to be cleaned up on the thread's exit. A future in C is a value which is claimed to show up in the futureThis is another example of a synchronization primitive!\nWhat do I do to make sure we can sagely delete the future? How do we know its not being pointed at anymore?\nGARBAGE COLLECTOR! We use reference counting to implement the garbage collectorBlocking is when I want to go and not even attempt to run until someone else unblocks me. With a future reffered to by it's getter which needs to wait until set, it blocks and teh setter comes back adn adds it to the ready queue.\nOur futureimp will have a list of what is waiting for us to go! It is also its own queueSet will assign the futureimpl value, update the value, and then go down this queue to wake the threads up by adding them to the ReadyQueue. Unfortch we have some tricky race conditions. I might be taking a second to add myself to the waiting queue, and when I'm doing that someone sets the variable and now I'll never be run.\nActing and reacting in a concurrent system demands a critical section.\nWe can throw a spin lock in here! Brief check while we check on the future and add to the queue, then get out of there. We have to promise for spin locks to have our critical section be very short ( with a small constant 15-20 instructions).\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#threads","#storage","#memory","#operatingSystems"],"headers":[{"heading":"Overview","level":1,"id":"Overview_0"},{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"<code class=\"code-styler-inline\">t0.test</code> in More Detail","level":2,"id":"`t0.test`_in_More_Detail_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"school/cs/cs-439/notes/1.7-more-on-the-tls.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":["supplemental-files/images/tmp-2.gif"],"createdTime":1770328970430,"modifiedTime":1770701944277,"sourceSize":5164,"sourcePath":"School/CS/CS 439/Notes/1.7 More on the TLS.md","exportPath":"school/cs/cs-439/notes/1.7-more-on-the-tls.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":13,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"school/physics/quantum-3/notes/1.7-review-of-quantum-mechanics.html":{"title":"1.7 Review of Quantum Mechanics","icon":"","description":"Today was a reintroduction to quantum mechanics!

Then rely for whoever changes our state to wake us up.\nWaiting queue is what this makesIf the queue is non-empty, it implies the flag is true.\nThe spin lock helps us manipulate the state that the lock is representing, without violating the rules.\nScheduling systems decide who goes next.If I'm trying to lock it1lock(){2\tspin.lock();3\tif(flag == false){4 // flag means taken, thsi means we can empty5 // have to add myself to waiting queue6 // switch to some other thread who should run7 // over me8 waiting.add(me);9 // at this point adding yourself to teh queue, but whoever is10 //holding the lock might grab you before you have a shot at 11 //switching12 block( 13 //we wanna context switch to someone, adn when we're done14 // switching me, release the locok15 )16 block_and_unlock();17 //context switch to someone else, then after safe switchung release the thread18\t}19}we can also do1lock(){2\tspin.lock();3\twhile(flag == false){4 me-&gt; leave_me_alone = true;56 waiting.add(me);7 spin.unlock();8 //take ur time with the blocking9 block();10 // or we can do11 block_and_add(&amp;waiting,&amp;spin);12 //add me to the queue and then switch13 spin.lock()14\t}15}Its a good idea to do a while loop over a conditional, then you grab the lock again so you can try one more timeAlways grab the lock, check the state, add yourself and block with the state race condition safe, then come back and never ask why. if you ever leave the loop, you know you have the lock and the state is good.How does unlock work?\nYou need to grab the spin=lock1unlock(){2\tspin.lock();3\tflag = false;4\t//wake up those whoare waiting5\twakeup = waiting.remove();6\t//grab the last guy from the queue7\tspin.unlock();8\treadyQueue.add(wakeup);9\t// the adding to rq isn't O(1) so we have to unlock before10\t}What happens if the holder of the lock dies? Who gets the lock\nThe most sane solution is to mark it as being tainted, if anyone tries to get it there will return a failure. The datastructure it was protecting is now tainted as well and has to be unused.\nIn rust, there's availible, taken, or tainted. Any attempt to lock a tainted lock will throw it.\nDatabase systems have a setup of undoing work, where you can undo back to before the bad process grabbed the lock, but the lock is still bad (why) even though we saved the DS\nThe get is a lot like the blocking lock()1get(){2\tspin.lock()3\twhile(!ready){4 block(&amp;waiting,&amp;spin);5 //tell to wait in waiting queue and release the spinlock6 spin.lock();7\t}8\tspin.unlock()9\t//do what u wanna do10}11These look a lot like the blocking lock! set looks a lot like unlock while get looks like lockIf you try to put somethign and the queue is full, you block into the lock for it. You get woken up by whoever makes the queue not full. In the bounded bugger, it gets more complex. Both methods can make a block. Block when you do a get and the queue is empty, or you do a block and the queue is fullAll the complexity and difficulty is in the synchronization logic. The DS itself is something you need uniquely for everyone. The synchronization logic is reusable!!There are two ways of doing this are very popular for good reason. One is a semaphoreThis is essentially an unsigned counterthis is wide enough so we can guarantee it will never overflow. You can never ask for the value of the counter, just change if it goes up or down.\nWe consider it safe to use a 64 bit counter, since 2^64 cycles is nor reachable within a century. Overflow will never happen. To prevent it from underflowing, we block. We protect it from underflowing by preventing down from succeeding. We wake up when someone says up.That behavior with the implementation of semaphore1class Semaphore{2\tprivate:3 //we dgaf4 //...5\tpublic:6 Semaphor(uint32_t);7 up();8 down();9\t};10}What this says is that we can now trivially implement a blocking lock1class BlockingLock{2\tprivate Semaphore sem{1};3\tpublic:4 void lock(){5 sem.down();6 }7 void unlock(){8 sem.up();9 }10}Now let's implement a future1class Future{2\tT value;3\tSemaphore sem{0};4\t//a future blocks from the getgo UNTIL we're set5\tpublic:6 get(){7 sem.down();8 // if we survive this, someone has signaled the semaphor, 9 // I can return10 sem.up();11 // THIS WAKES UP WHOEVER COMES UP AFTER US12 return value;13 }14 15 set(T v){16 value = v;17 sem.up();18 // unlike the lock we have to wakeup everyone19 // who;s waiting20 21 }22 23}It seems like we're not taking advantage of most of the semaphore domain, are there uses for it?\nYeah! We're using this as a binary semaphore\nThere's another universal synchronization primitive which is suited for things designed for everyoneIf we have nothing in the queue we want to block, if we have more than zero things we want to continue. Perfect semaphore use!1emptySlots;2full_slots();3get(){4\tfull_slots.down();5\t6\tv = dequeue();7\t// make the dequeue however we want, we need to have8\t// another lock for the queue since it's shared. Can be9\t// semaphore, \"its okay to be spin lock\"10\tlock.up();11\temptySlots.up();12}13put(){14\temptySlots.down();15\tlock.down();16\tenqueue(v);17\tlock.up();18\tfull_slots.up()19\t20}Runhas the effect of blocking us if the queue is empty, but it also has the effect of subtracting 1. Now when we say down() we accounted for 1, and we referred 1 for myself. Then compete and get a value. Why both full and empty slots?\nbecause sometimes you're blocking because it's full or because it's empty\nSemaphores just don't do as well when you need to broadcast wakeupsA Semaphore is a structure which has memory, it's stateful. If you add 1 to the counter you'll add it regardless of waiting people. it has a state which is remembered. Because it's stateful, we had to do the propagation of the state information down the chain. Can we have a synch primitive which is stateless.\nWhen all we have is a queue,, we refer to that as a condition variable. It's a queue of threads which are blocked. The variables doesn't care about the why, they just are. It's a list of all the threads waiting on something. Notify says to wake up at least 1 thread, notify all says to do all of them. If we had that (since it's a variable/type). There's no state if someone does a notify on it, it'll wake up everyone waiting. There's nothing inside me which says that I've been notified. It's stateless. Very little state needs to be implemented. There is some lock which has to be associated with our setup. Either it's embedded in the code inmplicitly, or you pass it with arguments.\nAttatching a condition with a lock, it becomes super useful.\nWait says \"add me to the queue, then release the lock\"\nWhen you call wait, you must be holding the lock\n1get(){2\tlock.lock()3\twhile(!ready){4 cond.wait5\t}6\tlock.unlock();7\treturn;8}Run1set(){2\tlock.lock()3\tv=val;4\tready=true;5\tcond.notifyAll();6\tlock.unlock();7}RunThis is honestly really useful of a structure. 1Condition notFull{};2//no initial value so they're stateless3Condition notEmpty{};4Lock lock;5get(){6\t//the one thign you know at the end of get is that the queue is not full7\tlock.lock();8\twhile(n==0){9 notEmpty.wait();10 // n is how many are in the queue11\t}12\tnotFull.notify();13}14put(){15\tlock.lock()16\twhile(n==limit){17 notFull.wait();18 // we'd only wake up from this part is if someone else 19 // signals a get20\t}21\t// we know at the end that the queue is not empty22\tnotEmpty.notify();23}RunThe problem with Conditions is that how everyone implements them is completely different. Once you pick semantics and stick to it, this is very powerful. Also semaphores and condition variables can implement each other! Condition Variables tend to be very light versus Semaphores are ridiculously heavy.What makes a semaphore heavy?? It's just a uint32","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Parallel","#operatingSystems","#asynch"],"headers":[{"heading":"Overview","level":1,"id":"Overview_0"},{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"Blocking Lock","level":2,"id":"Blocking_Lock_0"},{"heading":"Futures","level":2,"id":"Futures_0"},{"heading":"Bounded Buffer","level":2,"id":"Bounded_Buffer_0"},{"heading":"CountingSemaphores","level":2,"id":"CountingSemaphores_0"},{"heading":"Back to the Bounded Buffer!","level":2,"id":"Back_to_the_Bounded_Buffer!_0"},{"heading":"Condition Synch Primitive","level":2,"id":"Condition_Synch_Primitive_0"},{"heading":"Futures with Conditions","level":2,"id":"Futures_with_Conditions_0"},{"heading":"Bounded Buffer","level":2,"id":"Bounded_Buffer_1"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"school/cs/cs-439/notes/1.8-synchronization-primitives.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1770761022708,"modifiedTime":1770767482512,"sourceSize":10218,"sourcePath":"School/CS/CS 439/Notes/1.8 Synchronization Primitives.md","exportPath":"school/cs/cs-439/notes/1.8-synchronization-primitives.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":14,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"school/cs/cs-439/notes/1.9-smart-pointers.html":{"title":"1.9 Smart Pointers","icon":"","description":"Today we're talking about how we might handle wanting to wrap our references to an object with more intelligence!

If we want to guarantee that we have the only pointer to this object, we can make it illegal to attempt to copy it, or if you make a copy of it we revoke the original permissionWhat hapens if in the constructor for UniqueRef I pass in a pointer already? That external pointer isn't bound by our feeble rules\nThat's a design flaw! No good programmer should ever do this\nA common pattern is\n1auto p = UniquePtr&lt;int&gt;::make(10)Run\nThis way we can set the initial value while still never getting our hands on the pointer\nWe also have a copy constructor. The argument it takes is a reference to an object that exists and is not null.\nWhen we're transferring permissions across the UniqueRef, we don't need to worry about the time it takes to transfer ownership. It's like waking up to someone, ripping out their guts, and taking them.

What do we do when a unique pointer exits scope, once we're out that object is gone so we better destroy it on the way out.\nOnly ever pass a smart pointer around by value. The unique pointer is not meant to be shared. If we are passing it by reference \\A strong ref is an object which keeps track of a reference count. The object itself doesn't know it's wrapped in a strong referenceOur intermediate object holds our reference information, that way our smart pointers don't need to worry about all keeping track of each other. There's another implementation which is a bit more efficientTo implement this, we have some object which sits in the middleWhen I make a copy of a UniqueRef in a StrongRef, I lose the uniqueness criteria in it. We do it by just carving out the guts.\nWe say that the StrongRef itself is actually NOT thread safe. It doesn't mean we can't put a lock on a struct to keep it safe. All we're saying is that we can't save it's internal state by itself.\nThe intermediate middle object has to be thread safe, as we know we have multiple copies of StrongRef pointing to this. To make middle thread safe, we just need to make the counter atomic. it's what gets mutated the most frequently!\nIt's not our job to project the final object we point to. If they make it thread safe it will be! If the creator doesn't, then it won't. Whoever implemented the object is the one protecting it. Defensive programing via ASSERT(...) is very importantIf I want to have stronger oriented OOPs, we should make the Middle class have add and drop methods which return the final value, then the delete operator only needs to worry about deleting.\nC++ has friend classes where you can set some classes to be allowed to interact with your class's private variables.How do we implement comparisons between two smart pointers?\nDo we compare the pointer to middle or to the object? Well if there are multiple middles to an object then one middle could delete the object while another middle wants to access it\nFor the assignment operator he recommends having add_ref and drop_ref methods so we don't end up with huge blocks of repeating code in the instance that we want to reassign one smart pointer to the direction of anotherWhat do we do about this closed loop now? Well these two points in memory are now pointing to each other. These two objects can't be reached from the outside, with no purpose, but keeping each other alive.This is an isolated island! Cycles of strong references will cause these isolated lines. The price we pay is leaked memory.How do we fix this? We make it illegal for cycles in our access graph. We're going to make it a programming error which is undetectable by the compiler.The price we pay is that whenever we access a WeakRef, we have to ask it if it's valid. WeakRef does not override the arrow operator. We can think in terms of the middle classA strong counter of 1 meaning that we're still connected to our larger graph of access. A weak counter means that someone connected to me is someone I connect to\nHow many strong references that keep it alive enable it's existence.\nHow many weak references who are tethered have the responsibility to release the remaining middle. We preserve the decayed middle only to tell us if a former object still exists, and it saying that the number of strong counts is zero tells us it's gone.Why do we need to keep track of weak references","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#pointers","#operatingSystems","#cxx","#garbagecollection"],"headers":[{"heading":"Overview","level":1,"id":"Overview_0"},{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"Smart Pointers","level":2,"id":"Smart_Pointers_0"},{"heading":"Unique Ref","level":3,"id":"Unique_Ref_0"},{"heading":"Strong Ref","level":2,"id":"Strong_Ref_0"},{"heading":"Weak Pointer","level":2,"id":"Weak_Pointer_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"school/cs/cs-439/notes/1.9-smart-pointers.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1770933989569,"modifiedTime":1770940501995,"sourceSize":7500,"sourcePath":"School/CS/CS 439/Notes/1.9 Smart Pointers.md","exportPath":"school/cs/cs-439/notes/1.9-smart-pointers.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":15,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"school/physics/quantum-3/notes/1.9-creation-and-annihilation-operators.html":{"title":"1.9 Creation and Annihilation Operators","icon":"","description":"Midterm March 5thWrapped up what we did in <a data-href=\"1.8 Rotation\" href=\"school/physics/quantum-3/notes/1.8-rotation.html\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">1.8 Rotation</a><a data-href=\"1.8 Rotation\" href=\"school/physics/quantum-3/notes/1.8-rotation.html\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">1.8 Rotation</a>, and then introduced creation and annihilation operators!

Is it useful that we can correct that last error?\nIs there a connection to convergence of measure here?\nEven though the distance would not have us believe we can flip a two bit error, we can see that is just worst case! This can be useful if the first and last bit flipping is correlated\nyou can store every element in the vectorspace, but you still have exponential calculations with caching. This is the best possible way to correct errors. It's very expensive to do, arbitrary codes have us spending resources.\nTo avoid writing down the entire table, we'll use some other informationLarge codes this is just infeasible.

The claim: Every vector in the same coset (Row in the matrix) has the same syndrome: Example 1.6.3 (Decoding with Syndromes). If . The syndrome doesn't give a flip about what was sent, just about the error! The syndrome corresponds to our first column of . in general, weight 1 errors correspond to a single column in . Weight errors are linear combinations of columns in is many to one, many errors map to a single syndrome.\nUsing it to decode We can't correct the error though as it's a weight 2 error and it's outside our code-space's scope.

Definition 1.3.1 (Pointer).\nA pointer is a variable which stores a memory address\nThere's pass by value and pass by reference. In C giving an integer or struct, is by default pass by value. A pointer lets you actually manipulate the value you put into a function.By default functions use deep copies. An asterisk in C is how we declare a pointer. An asterisk is typically a type declaration. It can also be a dereference.\nAn ampersand lets you reference the value of something, grabbing a pointer to it. If pointer was already declared then we can remove the type deceleration components.

An asterisk on the left is different than the asterisk on the right. In Java if you want to make a new object, there was the new keyword. Java manages memory for us. Once I stop using an object then java throws it out. C doesn't do it.\nThis is why we use malloc which gives us the needed space\ncalloc will allocate some memory and zero it out. You need to do this if you want to have your arrays zero initialized\nfree lists some memory up for grabs.\nHaving memory leaks can cause programs to crash. If you throw away a pointer then you can't access what's at that point and can't free it.

It's either field a or field b which share one block of memory. A union has you change how interpret the same field.

Dynamic memory management refers to the algorithms and structures for allocating and deallocating objects of variable size in memory at program execution time.\nThe sequence data is given to the user, may not be the sequence it is returned to the computer. Lets say we fill in chairs row by row, but some peopled decide to leave early leaving holes! What that means is that we have to find a smart way to keep track of the data filling into the holes\nWe also need an interface for the OS incase the user requests for more memory than you currently have permission for.\nSome examples of the above concepts in C are malloc()/free and new/delete in C++\nThe thing that manages this is called the ALLOCATOR. We're designing an explicit memory allocator that the user is responsible for using. In Python and Java, they use an implicit memory allocator (called a garbage collector). We'll learn more about this in OS\nThese days when there is a guardrail which stops the stack from trying to collide with the heapThe allocator (malloc) has to keep track of which memory is marked as free, and which is marked as usedWhen I end up filling holes, I might fill that hole I'll probably leave behind a small sliver that no one can use. In that case, what do I even do? Because the odds of those small holes getting filled up are extraordinarily low\nThere's no hard and fast answer to this. You could give the entire space to someone more than they asked so you know you get it all back used, but then they can overuse it. It's all statistics\nWhenever we request memory from malloc, if I request for example bytes, it actually saves , where one byte is for the metadata representing the width of the memory block. The chunks of memory managed from the OS are not necessarily contiguous to the first program chunkDoes the OS have it's own allocator which is taking requests from ours? Does it just have access to the entire block of RAM?<img src=\"supplemental-files/images/pasted-image-20250916133639.png\" target=\"_self\">In this case, the application is the mutator which then interacts with the allocator and engaging with Clang.Time efficiency: Maximizing throughput as the number of requests we take at a time in order.\nCan't service the memory requests out of sequence\nTends to be the easier one to optimize for\nSpace Efficiency: Maximize memory utilization, minimizing the wanted space\nIf I request bytes as a payload, the allocator responds with a pointer to a block of bytes. The overhead of this operation was . Overhead can commonly come from things like alignment (the term for the question I asked earlier) and metadata\nYou can just keep requesting more memory from the operating system and never free memory up. It's great with time, horrible with space. Before you ever code when working with the lab, absolutely draw out how you plan on implementing your design. Can we research existing malloc implementations to base ours off of\nSure! But you have confined times so don't go overboard\nTo keep track of our memory, we're going to use a linked list. The first element in the list will be the first free memory spot, pointing to the block itself and the next node. The metadata keeps track of the pointer to the next location as well.

When managing these free lists, we need to keep into account\nFormat: What do the blocks look like? Organization How do we keep track of every free block? There is no correct answer to this in our lab. We have to figure out what we want to design exactly with all the corner cases in advance.

That way we know exactly where the size parameter sits. The size is 16 bytes back from the pointer in this case. Then what comes right before our pointer is the pointer to the next free block.The padding makes sure that the address that we have is a multiple of 16 bytes, always. We will not go through the reasons in here, but it's to do with keeping memory allocation efficiency (Is it related to memory buffers?). Keep things 16 bytes aligned\nIt's worth it to waste some space for this sake\nExample 4.3.1 (Possible memory allocation with padding). Free blocks also need to have size and padding. If I'm implementing a doubly linked list, no one is using the memory inside the payload. This doubly linked list becomes only doubly linked when it's not in use. You'd need to keep track of the previous pointer though when repopulating\nWhy do we put the header at the top though?The reason is because if our pointer was at the top, we wouldn't know where the size was! For example, in the left case size is located at . In the later case size is located at , but when we jump to the memory block we don't know the size!In an allocated block there is a block of memory that was apart of the free block linked list which is now useless. We can now put some well understood pattern into that section of memory which will warn us if someone had messed up with the data (someone might have overstepped).\nA common canary value in memory is often DEADBEEF <br>Silly question, wtf is deadbeef??\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=0xDEADBEEF&amp;redirect=no\" target=\"_self\">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=0xDEADBEEF&amp;redirect=no</a>\nWe are not allowed to use an explicit list in our memory management lab.

The below notes were made next class!A circular linked list might make things easier\nFirst Fit- When you pick the first possible place the memory can fit. Pro: Time fast\nCon: Biases your unusable small spaces near the beginning of the memory Next Fit- First time start from the head, find something for the first request, then when the next request comes in start from where you stopped. Implement via circular linked list Pro: Tiny holes are spread out across the memory\nCon: Not sure Best Fit- Pick the block over all the data which best sizes the requested memory Pro: Obvious heuristic, minimizes unused allocated memory\nCon: makes really small unusable memory chunks\nCauses internal fragmentation (fragmentation inside the space given internal to you) Worst Fit- Pick the worst fitting block and allocate it Pro: Makes larger usable chunks for blocks\nCon: Can be more difficult for splitting? Didn't catch this\nCauses external fragmentation (fragmentation in the blocks we can allocate) Do we split a free block after allocation or not split?\nOr maybe if the size is smaller than a certain threshold (For example if we're smaller than the size of the header) we don't allocate that area . Going from an allocated block to a free block, which means we have to update our datastructure. If the block being free is in the middle of two allocated block, there's no need for them to absorb each other.\nFrom last time, diagram of the problem:We're required to coalesce. Do we need to check every-time a block is freed whether it has to be merged, or to I merge everyone after times. For implementation I can make a parameter for the update, and then I can set it to 1 if I find out I want it to update each cycle. We can also use BOUNDARY TAGS!\nWe can make coalescing faster if we give each block it's metadata at the header and the footer. Then the current block can check if the previous one needs to be freed by subtracting 16 bits from it's current pointer. We couldn't do that before because we wouldn't know where it started for the metadata without already having the metadata. I also like this idea\nExercise 4.3.2 (AT HOME: Think about what happens to the boundary tags when the pointers update).","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#memory","#computerArch","#Computerscience"],"headers":[{"heading":"Overview","level":1,"id":"Overview_0"},{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"Free List Management","level":2,"id":"Free_List_Management_0"},{"heading":"Huge Design Space","level":2,"id":"Huge_Design_Space_0"},{"heading":"Keeping Track of Free Blocks","level":2,"id":"Keeping_Track_of_Free_Blocks_0"},{"heading":"Free Block Selection","level":2,"id":"Free_Block_Selection_0"},{"heading":"Free Block Splitting","level":2,"id":"Free_Block_Splitting_0"},{"heading":"Free Block Coallescing","level":2,"id":"Free_Block_Coallescing_0"}],"links":["school/cs/cs-429/notes/4.2-dynamic-memory-management-concepts.html","school/cs/cs-429/notes/4.2-dynamic-memory-management-concepts.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"school/cs/cs-429/notes/4.3-dynamic-memory-management-details.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":["supplemental-files/images/pasted-image-20250917132024.png","supplemental-files/images/pasted-image-20250917133719.png","supplemental-files/images/pasted-image-20250917134147.png","supplemental-files/images/pasted-image-20250917134335.png"],"createdTime":1761343066295,"modifiedTime":1761343066298,"sourceSize":10514,"sourcePath":"School/CS/CS 429/Notes/4.3 Dynamic Memory Management Details.md","exportPath":"school/cs/cs-429/notes/4.3-dynamic-memory-management-details.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":16,"backlinks":["school/cs/cs-429/notes/13.4-cache-structure-and-management.html"],"type":"markdown"},"school/cs/cs-429/notes/4.4-floating-point-data-1.html":{"title":"4.4 Floating Point Data 1","icon":"","description":"Note to the people reading the notes in the future: I'm a bit tired today so sorry if these are a bit sparse\nI updated the notes from 4.3 to include the first half of today's lecture for organization!

The pointers to the objects themselves don't move, but our outer pointer switches across them!\nObj*Obj*Obj*Obj**Object to hold the cases\nAt the machine level, the pointers themselves memory addresses don't contain any type information! It takes 64 bits to take me to any spot in my memory, so the width of the pointer itself has the same size. That then begs the question, where is the type stored?The value of a pointer is then the address.\nThe NULL pointer denotes a num pointer constant which can't be dereferenced. When a pointer is uninitialized it will hold the address of an arbitrary memory location. If I have an uninitialized pointer int *xp and I want to make it so that I can then initialize it with the location of int x, then I can use the dereference operator &amp;! With int* xp =&amp;x I then make the pointer directed toward where x is located.You can get the address in multiple ways.\nOne thing that doesn't make any sense is int **z = &amp;(x&amp;). The address of x is not an L value, it hasn't been stored anywhere so it has no address to dereference to. The type of a pointer tells us how the pointers should increment when we add to them! An int *p+1 will increment by 8 bytes, while if I casted to (char)*p+1 I'd move forward by 4 characters.Where is the type of a pointer then stored? Where are types stored at all in C?You can reference the name of an array as a pointer variable. The type of an array is just a pointer to the type it targets. *s = 'h's[0]='h'The width that you jump is equal to the type of your arrayCasting a pointer into a different type just changes the interpretation of the existing data. Nothing about the data itself changed.\nCasting obeys order of operations, so it slides in the same section as multiplication.

There will be more on this tomorrow since we ran over!\nToday we covered how objects are placed in memory and how that behaves.It is possible that we run across a problem where we request a section of memory, it gets broken in half! The microprocessor ends up having to request both chunks.Notice that char a in the diagram is still contiguous! But now I'm still across 2 bytesIn the above case if I were to split one datatype across bytes, I'd need to for one char access memory twice. Either I spend time cleaning up my memory so that this doesn't happen, or I increase the I/O bus bandwidth to make more We need to make sure that our objects are residing in well defined spotsBasic datatypes have at runtime known sizes in memory, but structs don't! AArch64 requires 4 byte alignment for instructionsFor any object had for a particular type, then those types have to be on boundaries of a certain size as a multiple of byte addresses.\nSomething is aligned ifThe address must be a multiple of the size.\nA character can go anywhere, a short has to exist at only even registers, a character can go anywhere.Did we need to accommodate that on the MM assignment?\nNope actual writing to memory is below our scope onto the OS. We just allocate\nAn aggregate object of a derived data type T (an array, struct, etc) is aligned IFF\nEvery sub-object is recursively aligned. Every sub-type must follow it's respective rules. Does this mean that the order that I define datatypes in a struct can change the amount of space?\nLike if I defined the short first, and then an int, would I reduce the space of the struct by changing the order?\nYEP! Switching around the types in a struct can reduce it's memory size. Declaring variables in an accommodating order will reduce their memory usage And there's also the array rule, every element of an object y of type \"Array of T\" is also aligned. Does that mean the SIZE of a struct/abstracted datatype, then is the alignment requirement a multiple of that?\nNO! That only applies for primitives. We align abstracted datatypes based on the primitive type containing it which requires the most memory\nFor every object, there are two decisions which have to be made. What the address is, and what the size of the object in. Basic types only have to decide the address\nWith complex types we have to also determine the size!\nDerived types demand this analysis on the padding.

We make a prediction, hopefully a good prediction, and then take corrective action in case we're wrong. Static branch prediction methods are the primitive ones that we think about, but irl they do dynamic branch prediction methods to figure out where to go next.\nF- For us, If you see a capital letter like F,D,MX,W it tells you which register it's coming from. If we predict correctly that the branch was taken, all is good. If the prediction was incorrect, we have to go back and do work from the sequential successor pc of that branch instruction. We retained that in the predict_pc backpack though so we can do work with it!How do we check if our prediction was right?\nWhen we hit execute, you evaluate the condition over there and will know then if the condition is true or false\nWhen we have the condition, we just come back around and check against the condition to overwrite it. The situation of returning (with the opcode being a return)\nWith the return we call it \"minus one\". The priority is taking the seq_succ_pc, then the next up is val_a, and finally just continue with your prediction as the last possible option.

Hazards are our dependency problems. They are a boolean valued function of an ISA implementation , with a set of instructions with or . If the non-pipelined version results in a different answer between my implementation of pipeline, we know it caused a problem.The ideal distance between two instructions with dependency is three. The subsequent instruction will need the previous information at decode, but the initial instruction will put pen to paper at writeback. If we let them be 3 apart, then we're safe because our previous instruction wrote to memory in time. What components of the machine can cause hazards?\nThe control would have it (read in F, written in F,X,M) We can't let program dependencies become hazards.

Within my space of correct solution, take the one which gives us the best efficiency\nSolutions are described in terms of \"policies\" and \"mechanisms\"\nPolicies - What we gotta do\nMechanisms - How we're gonna do it\nTo stall for data hazards, we put ghost instructions which cause no effect so that the useful information can propagate.

The useful things about the ghosts is that they stop the entire flow of instruction. This is stallingLoad Use Hazard - You're trying to load something from your memory to registers, and the next instruction is trying to read it. Branch prediction right now is predicting that we took that path. We need to know in fetch where to branch, but know the condition in executer.\nWe can't just leave those faulty instruction there, unlike bubbling we need to throw them out. This is squashingIn our existing FDXMW model, we understand data as coming in from the left, and going out on the right.

Direct memory addressing lets me access memory directly without bothering the processor itself.\nEach type of I/O interface enable us to perform some memory access operations without involving our poor CPU.To read something from memory, you have to create the address first.
